/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<hr>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of how SageMaker works we will try to use it to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.</p>
<h2 id="Instructions">Instructions<a class="anchor-link" href="#Instructions">&#182;</a></h2><p>Some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this notebook. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with '<strong>TODO</strong>' in the header indicate that you need to complete or implement some portion within them. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a <code># TODO: ...</code> comment. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!</p>
<p>In addition to implementing code, there will be questions for you to answer which relate to the task and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a '<strong>Question:</strong>' header. Carefully read each question and provide your answer below the '<strong>Answer:</strong>' header by editing the Markdown cell.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the <strong>Shift+Enter</strong> keyboard shortcut. In addition, a cell can be edited by typically clicking it (double-click for Markdown cells) or by pressing <strong>Enter</strong> while it is highlighted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="General-Outline">General Outline<a class="anchor-link" href="#General-Outline">&#182;</a></h2><p>Recall the general outline for SageMaker projects using a notebook instance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download or otherwise retrieve the data.</li>
<li>Process / Prepare the data.</li>
<li>Upload the processed data to S3.</li>
<li>Train a chosen model.</li>
<li>Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job).</li>
<li>Deploy the trained model.</li>
<li>Use the deployed model.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this project, you will be following the steps in the general outline with some modifications.</p>
<p>First, you will not be testing the model in its own step. You will still be testing the model, however, you will do it by deploying your model and then using the deployed model by sending the test data to it. One of the reasons for doing this is so that you can make sure that your deployed model is working correctly before moving forward.</p>
<p>In addition, you will deploy and use your trained model a second time. In the second iteration you will customize the way that your trained model is deployed by including some of your own code. In addition, your newly deployed model will be used in the sentiment analysis web app.</p>

This film, by Oscar Petersson, is unique. Its uniqueness doesn&#39;t lie in the story, since many a half brained Hollywood production has served us comparably miserable plots, but rather in the thorough way that complete and utter lousiness in one aspect is joined with equal lousiness in all other aspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialog is worse than embarrassing. Rotten acting and abysmal direction are thrown into the mix. Bosnians speaking English with heavy Swedish accents add an unintentional element of humor. Uninspired lightning and camera-work are icing on the turkey film cake. As a sort of surprise for the audience, there are a few completely unmotivated slow motion sequences where you&#39;d least expect any. To add insult to injury, the whole thing is cut by someone devoid of any sense of timing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#34;bad guy henchman turns good after hearing good guy&#39;s speech&#34; scene in the church, is the point at which is time to dethrone Ed Wood from the position as the worst director of all times; Move over Ed Wood - here comes Oscar Petersson!

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Above we mentioned that <code>review_to_words</code> method removes html formatting and allows us to tokenize the words found in a review, for example, converting <em>entertained</em> and <em>entertaining</em> into <em>entertain</em> so that they are treated as though they are the same word. What else, if anything, does this method do to the input?</p>

<p>The method below applies the <code>review_to_words</code> method to each of the reviews in the training and testing datasets. In addition it caches the results. This is because performing this processing step can take a long time. This way if you are unable to complete the notebook in the current session, you can come back without needing to process the data a second time.</p>

<h2 id="Transform-the-data">Transform the data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Transform-the-data">&#182;</a></h2><p>In the XGBoost notebook we transformed the data from its word representation to a bag-of-words feature representation. For the model we are going to construct in this notebook we will construct a feature representation which is very similar. To start, we will represent each word as an integer. Of course, some of the words that appear in the reviews occur very infrequently and so likely don't contain much information for the purposes of sentiment analysis. The way we will deal with this problem is that we will fix the size of our working vocabulary and we will only include the words that appear most frequently. We will then combine all of the infrequent words into a single category and, in our case, we will label it as <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Since we will be using a recurrent neural network, it will be convenient if the length of each review is the same. To do this, we will fix a size for our reviews and then pad short reviews with the category 'no word' (which we will label <code>0</code>) and truncate long reviews.</p>

<h3 id="(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">(TODO) Create a word dictionary<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">&#182;</a></h3><p>To begin with, we need to construct a way to map words that appear in the reviews to integers. Here we fix the size of our vocabulary (including the 'no word' and 'infrequent' categories) to be <code>5000</code> but you may wish to change this to see how it affects the model.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>TODO:</strong> Complete the implementation for the <code>build_dict()</code> method below. Note that even though the vocab_size is set to <code>5000</code>, we only want to construct a mapping for the most frequently appearing <code>4998</code> words. This is because we want to reserve the special labels <code>0</code> for 'no word' and <code>1</code> for 'infrequent word'.</p>

In particular, a model comprises three objects</p>
<ul>
<li>Model Artifacts,</li>
<li>Training Code, and</li>
<li>Inference Code,</li>
</ul>
<p>each of which interact with one another. In the XGBoost example we used training and inference code that was provided by Amazon. Here we will still be using containers provided by Amazon with the added benefit of being able to include our own custom code.</p>
<p>We will start by implementing our own neural network in PyTorch along with a training script. For the purposes of this project we have provided the necessary model object in the <code>model.py</code> file, inside of the <code>train</code> folder. You can see the provided implementation by running the cell below.</p>

<p>The important takeaway from the implementation provided is that there are three parameters that we may wish to tweak to improve the performance of our model. These are the embedding dimension, the hidden dimension and the size of the vocabulary. We will likely want to make these parameters configurable in the training script so that if we wish to modify them we do not need to modify the script itself. We will see how to do this later on. To start we will write some of the training code in the notebook so that we can more easily diagnose any issues that arise.</p>
<p>First we will load a small portion of the training data set to use as a sample. It would be very time consuming to try and train the model completely in the notebook as we do not have access to a gpu and the compute instance that we are using is not particularly powerful. However, we can work on a small bit of the data to get a feel for how our training script is behaving.</p>

<h2 id="Step-5:-Testing-the-model">Step 5: Testing the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-5:-Testing-the-model">&#182;</a></h2><p>As mentioned at the top of this notebook, we will be testing this model by first deploying it and then sending the testing data to the deployed endpoint. We will do this so that we can make sure that the deployed model is working correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">Step 6: Deploy the model for testing<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">&#182;</a></h2><p>Now that we have trained our model, we would like to test it to see how it performs. Currently our model takes input of the form <code>review_length, review[500]</code> where <code>review[500]</code> is a sequence of <code>500</code> integers which describe the words present in the review, encoded using <code>word_dict</code>. Fortunately for us, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with simple inputs such as this.</p>
<p>There is one thing that we need to provide, however, and that is a function which loads the saved model. This function must be called <code>model_fn()</code> and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored. This function must also be present in the python file which we specified as the entry point. In our case the model loading function has been provided and so no changes need to be made.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When the built-in inference code is run it must import the <code>model_fn()</code> method from the <code>train.py</code> file. This is why the training code is wrapped in a main guard ( ie, <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code> )</p>
<p>Since we don't need to change anything in the code that was uploaded during training, we can simply deploy the current model as-is.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When deploying a model you are asking SageMaker to launch an compute instance that will wait for data to be sent to it. As a result, this compute instance will continue to run until <em>you</em> shut it down. This is important to know since the cost of a deployed endpoint depends on how long it has been running for.</p>
<p>In other words <strong>If you are no longer using a deployed endpoint, shut it down!</strong></p>

<p>The question we now need to answer is, how do we send this review to our model?</p>
<p>Recall in the first section of this notebook we did a bunch of data processing to the IMDb dataset. In particular, we did two specific things to the provided reviews.</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed any html tags and stemmed the input</li>
<li>Encoded the review as a sequence of integers using <code>word_dict</code></li>
</ul>
<p>In order process the review we will need to repeat these two steps.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Using the <code>review_to_words</code> and <code>convert_and_pad</code> methods from section one, convert <code>test_review</code> into a numpy array <code>test_data</code> suitable to send to our model. Remember that our model expects input of the form <code>review_length, review[500]</code>.</p>

<p>As we saw above, by default the estimator which we created, when deployed, will use the entry script and directory which we provided when creating the model. However, since we now wish to accept a string as input and our model expects a processed review, we need to write some custom inference code.</p>
<p>We will store the code that we write in the <code>serve</code> directory. Provided in this directory is the <code>model.py</code> file that we used to construct our model, a <code>utils.py</code> file which contains the <code>review_to_words</code> and <code>convert_and_pad</code> pre-processing functions which we used during the initial data processing, and <code>predict.py</code>, the file which will contain our custom inference code. Note also that <code>requirements.txt</code> is present which will tell SageMaker what Python libraries are required by our custom inference code.</p>
<p>When deploying a PyTorch model in SageMaker, you are expected to provide four functions which the SageMaker inference container will use.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>model_fn</code>: This function is the same function that we used in the training script and it tells SageMaker how to load our model.</li>
<li><code>input_fn</code>: This function receives the raw serialized input that has been sent to the model's endpoint and its job is to de-serialize and make the input available for the inference code.</li>
<li><code>output_fn</code>: This function takes the output of the inference code and its job is to serialize this output and return it to the caller of the model's endpoint.</li>
<li><code>predict_fn</code>: The heart of the inference script, this is where the actual prediction is done and is the function which you will need to complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the simple website that we are constructing during this project, the <code>input_fn</code> and <code>output_fn</code> methods are relatively straightforward. We only require being able to accept a string as input and we expect to return a single value as output. You might imagine though that in a more complex application the input or output may be image data or some other binary data which would require some effort to serialize.</p>
<h3 id="(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">(TODO) Writing inference code<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">&#182;</a></h3><p>Before writing our custom inference code, we will begin by taking a look at the code which has been provided.</p>

<h3 id="Deploying-the-model">Deploying the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#Deploying-the-model">&#182;</a></h3><p>Now that the custom inference code has been written, we will create and deploy our model. To begin with, we need to construct a new PyTorchModel object which points to the model artifacts created during training and also points to the inference code that we wish to use. Then we can call the deploy method to launch the deployment container.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The default behaviour for a deployed PyTorch model is to assume that any input passed to the predictor is a <code>numpy</code> array. In our case we want to send a string so we need to construct a simple wrapper around the <code>RealTimePredictor</code> class to accomodate simple strings. In a more complicated situation you may want to provide a serialization object, for example if you wanted to sent image data.</p>

<pre>Id just like to say that the film was good and touching. The film explains to you the real meaning of being saved or born again and is very well set out. The acting was quite good but could do with some improvements. The story Board is catchy and when my church had youth service and we watched it,8 people gave there life to Christ. Id just like to say too anyone who is reading this, give your life to Christ and repent from your sin. PLease visit www.lifeofacristian.piczo.com Thank you Andrew&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The word of God will not turn Void. So Get saved and repent from your sin!

Don\&#39;t ask me how it happened, but I suppose having the film feature Ed &#34;I\&#39;ll Sponsor Anything&#34; McMahon as a tail-chasing crack hustler had a bit to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I was disappointed with Slaughter\&#39;s first outing in 1972. Nothing more than a quick throw-together to follow Shaft-mania. How does the sequel get away from this? Big Jim Brown seems stronger as Slaughter here than in the first. Perhaps this is due to the fact that one year later he had something to work from, instead of his simple &#34;Be like Shaft&#34; motivation before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most outstanding part about the film is the soundtrack provided by pimp-daddy number one, James Brown. Almost every scene is graced with a touch of funk by the Godfather. An excellent period film, for the music, wardrobe, vehicles, lingo, and hair. I should also point out this film is also an excellent period film to represent a time in motion picture history when Jim Brown and Ed McMahon could actually GROW hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Double the chicks, double the blow, triple the body count, and factor in Ed McMahon and James Brown. You\&#39;ll be in for one hell of a 70s action flick, and one that outshines it\&#39;s predecessor no less. For my money, Slaughter\&#39;s Big Rip-Off can play ball with any Blaxploitation film ever made. Even Shaft. Chances are you\&#39;ll disagree, but Slaughter\&#39;s Big Rip-Off has it\&#39;s own distinct feel. Something the original was lacking.&#39;

b&#34;Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s magic continues with this absolute crowd pleaser Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, his latest animated film, which turns on the usual sweetness to charm your socks off. I thought that the trailer featured its song which was quietly hypnotic, and I didn&#39;t have to wait for an invite to make sure I got my ticket for the sneak preview of the movie, scheduled to open here next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fans of Studio Ghibli films, you&#39;ll probably know what you&#39;re in for, as Miyazaki has yet another winner in his filmography, that will win new fans over. I&#39;m embarrassed to say the least that I&#39;ve so far watched only My Neighbour Totoro (eyes that pile of Ghibli DVDs) and love it to bits, but I guess this would serve as a final push for me not to continue missing what would likely be animated films that I would enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ponyo (voiced by Nara Yuria) is a magic goldfish that yearns to know what is life beyond the sea, with her constant forays in a bubble to the surface of the water to sneak a peek. Nonetheless these ambitions do not bode well with her humanoid dad Fujimoto (Tokoro Joji), who harbours some hatred toward the human race for pollution, and briefly touching a subplot on environmental protection / revenge by Mother Nature as well. An accident one day sees Ponyo being washed ashore, and picked up by five year old boy Sosuke (Doi Hiroki) who lives on a house on the said cliff with his mother Lisa (Yamaguchi Tomoko), while dad Koichi (Nagashima Kazushige) is mostly out to sea since he&#39;s a sailor. And you can expect some moments of throwback to the likes of The Little Mermaid, or Splash made for kids. Saying anything more would be to spoil the fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The artwork here is still simply astounding even though it&#39;s in 2D glory, knowing that each cell is painstakingly worked on. There are so many things going on at the same time within the same frame, that you&#39;ll probably be game for repeated viewings just to spot them all. This definitely beats any 3D or CG animated production any day given its beauty coming from its simplicity, and not only from the artwork department, but on its story too, despite complaints coming in that it took a leaf from the Hans Christian Andersen classic. While there are avenues to make this film extremely dark, it only suggested certain dark themes, but opted instead for a film with more positive emotions, suitable for both kids and adults alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At its core, its about love, that between the family members of Koichi, Lisa and Sosuke, and especially between mother and son. More so, it&#39;s about the love between the boy and his new pet fish which he christened Ponyo, and I tell you Ponyo herself has enough cuteness in her to beat the likes of Bolt, WallE and Eve all hands down. Characterization here is top notch, and it&#39;s hard not to fall in love with Ponyo, in whichever form adopted, especially when she&#39;s such a playful being who doesn&#39;t hide her emotions - if she&#39;s upset with you, either she turns away or you could expect a jet stream come spewing from her mouth into your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is a definite shoo-in to my top films of this year without hesitation. And the next time I go to Tokyo, I&#39;m sure as hell going to make my way to the Ghibli Museum to bask under the magical world brought to us by Hayao Miyazaki. Highly recommended film, so don&#39;t you go missing this on the big screen!&#34;

Id just like to say too anyone who is reading this, give your life to Christ and repent from your sin.

b&#39;This movie is based on the book, &#34;A Many Splendored Thing&#34; by Han Suyin and tackles issues of race relations between Asians and Whites, a topic that comes from Han\&#39;s personal experiences as an Eurasian growing up in China. That background, and the beautiful Hong Kong settings, gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself. The beautiful Jennifer Jones looks the part and gives a wonderful, Oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of Communism in mainland China. William Holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world. The acting is top notch, and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinematography really brings out fifty\&#39;s Hong Kong, especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments. The ending is a real tear-jerker. Some may consider sentimental romances pass\xc3\xa9, but, for those who enjoy classic Hollywood love stories, this is a shining example.&#39;

b&#39;_Saltmen_ is a long film for its genre, and quite often the pace is much slower than that expected by Western audiences. That being said, I enjoyed it thoroughly both in terms of interesting subject matter and the magnificent images this film contains. Some of the scenery is truly breathtaking, and there is enough of interest that most should be able survive _Saltmen_ with minimal use of the fast-forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;

b&#39;Viewed this GREAT Classic film of Greta Garbo and thought her performance was excellent. However, the German film version which had English captions was her greatest performance. Greta Garbo even mentioned to the press that the German film was her favorite where she had to make the change from Silent films to sound. Greta had a high pitched voice and had to take lessons in order to lower her voice for her future roles in films. This story was very sad because Greta Garbo(Anna Christie),&#34;Ninotchka&#34;,\&#39;39, was abused on a farm by young boys and her father left her years ago as a sailor and then as a coal barge captain. There were many scenes of Old NYC, the Brooklyn Bridge, Coney Island and the sky line of Manhattan. Charles Bickford(Matt Burke),&#34;Days of Wine &amp; Roses&#34;,\&#39;62 a Classic veteran actor gave a great supporting role.&#39;

b&#34;See No Evil is the first film from WWE films. Yes WWE, Word Wrestling Entertainment, pro wrestling. Of course being that it&#39;s a WWE film a wrestler has to star in it, the wrestler being Glenn Jacobs aka Kane. Which is not really important as if you didn&#39;t know Kane or what WWE stood for you would never know it had anything to do with the wild word of wrestling, as the movie has nothing to do with wrestling. See No Evil is gross out horror film, it has some moments were the some people may jump but for the most part it&#39;s just saying, hey look how gross we can get! Not that there is anything wrong with that. Jacob Goodnight (played by Kane) is sort of a Jason type character, his mother tortured him as a kid with strict (understatement) Christian beliefs and has warped his mind. Now he&#39;s a big scary chopping killing machine. 90% of the movie takes place in an abandon hotel where Jacob stalks six teenagers (surprised?) and a handful of adults. I could explain why they are in a creepy old hotel but eh, who cares? Despite it&#39;s lack of originality See No Evil is well made, for what it&#39;s supposed to be. Kane plays an awesome killer and needs little make up to be scary. One flaw in the movie is the most annoying possibility people survive, I really looking forward to having them being horribly killed, but alas, does not happen. I wish the film didn&#39;t have the stigma of wrestling attached to it, although like I said the film has nothing to with wrestling, people are still closed minded enough not to want to see it because, given of course if they are a wrestling hater. Then again the movie may also make money because Wrestling fans will want to see it. Either way, See No Evil has top notch effects and little CGI, and like I said, it&#39;s quite brutal so like I say it&#39;s good stuff....if you like that sort of thing.&#34;

b&#39;This is a quirky heist/caper film, one that seems predictable at first then keeps surprising until the last scene. The protagonist is a grifter who goes to work in a little carnival, where he\&#39;s paid to kill the manager\&#39;s belly dancer wife Divana then ends up falling for her himself. She\&#39;s alluring, tricky and deadly and she keeps disappearing and popping up again like some sort of magician\&#39;s trick. The film\&#39;s other props include her duplicitous husband/employer (played by the talented Armand Assante), some nasty Dominican mobsters and most important to the plot, a suitcase full of money. Just like the old &#34;shell game,&#34; the one where you have to guess which one the pea\&#39;s under, you\&#39;ll be guessing who\&#39;s got the money, and like the victims of the hucksters who run such games, you\&#39;ll probably guess wrong. Dagma Dominczyk, as lovely Divana, is a talented performer and an eyeful, whether she\&#39;s dancing with the huge snake around her shoulders or working her grift on all the unfortunate men in her orbit. Norman Reedus is fine as the young con who is flummoxed by the elusive beauty he was paid to kill. Don\&#39;t count him out, however, for he turns out to be smarter than anyone gave him credit for. This oddball film is worth a look.&#39;

b&#39;In Alfred Hitchcock\&#39;s adaptation of Patricia Highsmith\&#39;s &#34;Strangers On A Train&#34;, Guy Haines (Farley Granger)and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker)meet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of carrying out two murders. The rather pushy Anthony suggests that he could murder Haines\&#39; unfaithful wife and Haines could murder Anthony\&#39;s domineering father. The lack of any connection between the murderer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes would remain unsolved. The tenor of the conversation leaves the more easy going Haines with the impression that the proposal is not entirely serious. Complications arise later when Anthony murders Haines\&#39; wife in an amusement park and then pursues Haines to keep his side of the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The differences between the two men are clear from the start. Haines is a professional tennis player, respectable and rather modest about his achievements whereas Anthony\&#39;s life is going nowhere and he admits to having been thrown out of three colleges for drinking and gambling. Haines is in a relationship with a Senator\&#39;s daughter who he wants to marry. Anthony characteristically interprets this as a cynical manoeuvre on Haines\&#39; part to provide himself with a shortcut to a career. The character differences are also reinforced visually. Anthony often inhabits shadowed areas and travels in a boat called &#34;Pluto&#34; whereas Haines is frequently seen from the more heroic perspective provided by low camera angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some striking visual sequences such as:- &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) The murder of Haines\&#39; wife which is shown through the reflection of her glasses which fall to the ground as she struggles to free herself from Anthony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) The depiction of Anthony alone, dressed in black and looking very small against the enormous white Jefferson Memorial building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) The occasion where all the spectators at a tennis match are moving their heads in unison, following the action, whilst one head (Anthony\&#39;s) chillingly remains fixed in a position looking at Haines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4)The scene where the roundabout goes wildly out of control and eventually crashes spectacularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frequent use is made of &#34;doubles&#34; throughout the story, for example, Haines and Anthony are originally introduced as 2 pairs of feet getting out of their taxis and going to the train. As the train pulls out of the station, there are 2 sets of tracks each providing a choice of 2 ways forward. The 2 men discuss the murders of 2 potential victims and order 2 double whiskies. The Hitchcock cameo sees him struggling on board the train carrying a double bass. Haines feels double crossed when his wife reneges on an agreement they had for her to see a lawyer to arrange a divorce. Haines\&#39; wife goes to the amusement park with 2 boyfriends. When Anthony confronts her before the murder he lights his cigarette lighter and produces 2 reflections in her glasses. Anthony later becomes very disconcerted when he meets the Senator\&#39;s younger daughter who he sees as a double for Haines\&#39; wife. Anthony also feels double crossed when Haines refuses to go ahead with the second murder. When Haines is travelling alone in a train going to Metcalf, he sees 2 men in the same carriage accidentally kicking their feet together in the same way that he and Anthony had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The action throughout the movie proceeds at a great pace and the performances of Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock (as the Senator\&#39;s younger daughter) are particularly powerful.&#39;

b&#39;In these modern times (as subject known quite well to the director of the short film that this German count is going to talk about\xc2\x85), politically correct films are the &#34;leitmotiv&#34; of the modern young filmmakers\&#39; projects. &#34;Shoulder Arms&#34; directed by Herr Charlie Chaplin during WWI (the film was released only a few weeks before the armistice) is an obvious example of why the early cinema pioneers were a very bold people, certainly! To direct a humorous film inspired in the terrible, bloody First World War was a complicated matter that only few directors with those dangerous and daring ideas could be allowed to do\xc2\x85 to venture upon such delicate enterprise and with success was reserved only to geniuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this German count said, &#34;Shoulder Arms&#34; was made during WWI, that time in where definitely the whole world lost its innocence (fortunately not the German fat heiresses of this aristocrat\xc2\x85) and it is a hilarious, inventive social satire about that and any war. The film it is full of great gags and entertaining film continuity for a story in where that tramp will live though risky and courageous adventures in the front \xc2\x85whether a hero for the allies\xc2\x85 or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To mock the war trenches, the unhealthiness, the frontal attacks and the Germans (how you dare!!... by the way, there are a lot of inaccuracies in the film \xc2\x85 the German soldiers by that time had moustaches and longer beards not to mention that the Kaiser lacks many medals in his uniform\xc2\x85) in an elegant, funny and delicate way it is even today a film miracle impossible of being surpassed. Keeping in mind those terrible wartime circumstances, the difficult task is only possible thanks to a lot of creativity and talent. Obviously Herr Charlie Chaplin had very much of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, if you\&#39;ll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must go back to the Schloss trenches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/&#39;

b&#39;I saw this film last night at a &#34;pre-Code&#34; film festival, and I have to tell you that when Gary Cooper turned his head for his introductory close-up, the entire audience gasped. He was just that beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooper\&#39;s looks aside, this film displays Rouben Mamoulian\&#39;s directorial artistry to perfection. Wonderful scene-fades, creative camera angles, symbolic allusions--Mamoulian just keeps exploring the directorial medium and coming up with innovation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was Sylvia Sidney\&#39;s first role in Hollywood, after her success on the New York stage, and she is just as lovely as a Gary Cooper leading lady ought to be. It\&#39;s nice to see her in a role with a harder edge than many she was given--so often she looks like she\&#39;s afraid she\&#39;s about to be hit by someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of familiar faces in this film, including the wonderful Wynne Gibson. Most striking is Guy Kibbee, best known for playing fatuous rich men, as a grinning and mendacious hit-man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren\&#39;t nearly enough of these pre-Code films available on VHS or DVD, so if you can\&#39;t find a pre-Code festival near you, try campaigning Turner Classic Movies for a broadcast! As for the reviewer who believes Gary Cooper was too stupid to have dialogue more complex than &#34;Yep&#34; or &#34;Nope,&#34; he should perhaps consider Coop\&#39;s performance in films such as &#34;Mr Deeds Goes to Town&#34; or &#34;Meet John Doe.&#34; Although heaven knows anyone who looked that good shouldn\&#39;t have to be smart as well.&#39;

b&#34;I was a child when I saw this serial, a bit after seen Buck Rogers one, both characters performed by the same Buster Crabbe, and I must acknowledge that these films have always been part of the best entertainment I&#39;ve ever had. The fight against Emperor Ming was one thing but I was more interested to know about the final fate of the love triangle of Flash with Dale and Aura. Barin came and persuaded Aura to forget Flash, very innocent termination of her obsession for good-looking Flash. The serial has no offensive and really violent scenes and can be watched by all audiences. Another thing is that I learned floating in water looking the way Crabbe did it when fighting against shark men. The soundtrack was also nice although it was used previously in another film of Boris Karloff&#39;s Frankenstein. It would be nice to have the DVD of this serial provided that it comes with subtitles in Spanish (not yet available).&#34;

b&#39;This is by far my favorite action movie. But what makes it work is not the elaborate Renny Harlin explosions and shoot-em-ups. It\&#39;s the Shane Black script and its deft delivery by Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chemistry between the two principals merited a sequel. Thank God it was never made. Too much danger of marring the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\&#39;The Long Kiss\&#39; checkerboards from quotable scene to action scene to quotable scene and back again. Never a dull moment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has to be Jackson\&#39;s funniest role ever, and the amazing thing is that he is playing one of the most normal characters of his career. No quirky Tarantino hit-man, super-cool Shaft, or borderline psycho soldier. In TLKG, Jackson is the everyman we identify with. The poor schmuck gets dragged along on this crazy woman\&#39;s odyssey to uncover the dangerous secret of her past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the story claims that Davis\&#39;s character, Samantha Caine is suffering from amnesia, the writer and director treat her condition as if it were a multiple personality disorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samantha Caine is not just a new identity taken by the amnesiac Charly Baltimore -- she is a separate, fully-developed personality. The traumas suffered by Samantha in the first half-hour of the movie help the submerged dissociate personality of Charly to emerge again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The materials of her past life excavated by Jackson\&#39;s detective Mitch Henessey facilitate Charly\&#39;s resurfacing. Good timing, too, considering the target Samantha makes of herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Charly has to fight herself to remain the dominant personality. One gathers from bits of dialogue that the warrior personality (Charly) developed after her father died and she was recruited by the &#34;Chapter&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the eight years Charly was buried in the psyche, though, her Samantha identity developed into the dominant personality. (She\&#39;s even funnier that Charly.) This was probably due to becoming a mother, because it\&#39;s the reunion with her daughter that breaks Charly\&#39;s struggle to suppress Samantha, leading to their apparent integration by movie\&#39;s end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s impossible to choose a &#34;best quote&#34; from this film:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Now you\&#39;re a sharpshooter?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;I saved your ass. It was great!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Continue dying. Out.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;I sock \&#39;em in the jaw and yell \&#39;Pop goes the weasel\&#39;&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a couple of dozen more, many too raunchy to quote here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geena Davis looks great, and comes off as an action hero without glossing over the fact she\&#39;s turning forty. (Listen to Charley\&#39;s history, do the math).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic soundtrack, too. Santana, Muddy Waters, Elvis, LaBelle, Marvin Gaye. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give \&#39;The Long Kiss Goodnight\&#39; a 9, only because I don\&#39;t believe in a perfect 10. Seen it a dozen times, and it still stays fresh. Nice twisted holiday flick to place on your shelf next to \&#39;It\&#39;s A Wonderful Life.\&#39;&#39;

b&#34;I actually caught an ad for JAPAN SINKS in a Japanese magazine last year, and wondered what the heck it was until I saw the trailer for the film. It was then I remembered that I had seen the English translation of Sakyo Komatsu&#39;s novel some years back. I got it, and it was quite good, as well as chillingly realistic. It&#39;s enough to make the reader dread hearing any news about earthquakes in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#39;ve read the book, and seen this 2006 movie version (the first movie came out in 1973). And you know what? I thought the movie was quite good, even if there are major changes from novel to film (but that&#39;s understandable). The story is simple--a major tectonic shift will cause Japan to sink within a year. Massive earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis rock the country as frantic efforts are made to evacuate as many people as possible. One scientist has a plan that could stop the sinking of the country and save what&#39;s left of the landmass, but can it be implemented in time? I saw JAPAN SINKS at Otakon 2007, and while there were a couple of problems I had with it--it does run a bit too long, and a couple of the character moments were a little too sappy--I was nonetheless blown away. The sheer concept of an entire nation sinking into the sea was made terrifyingly real, and the effects were some of the best I&#39;ve ever seen, rivaling anything that Hollywood has done. The film also plays no favorites with the main characters, with some not making it to the closing credits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I&#39;ve been surprised by some of the negative comments made about this film. Difference of opinions, I guess. Personally, I enjoyed it. And I&#39;ve read the original book.&#34;

b&#34;SPOILERS AHEAD\xc2\x97 For the first ten minutes or so of Star Witness we&#39;re introduced to a quote typical urban American family unquote in a nameless city, which is another way of saying Warner Brothers&#39; version of NYC. Except for the young children, including the charming Dickie Moore, and sprightly Sally Blane, they&#39;re a pretty dreary lot, and their dinner table conversation is tedious and we wish the story would move along and bring in the star, Walter Huston. But wait, folks, wait. All of a sudden serious gangster movie action breaks out, drawing the family in against their will, and after that this baby never lets up. There&#39;s suspense, an Oscar-nominated script, good acting; everything you want old movies to be\xc2\x97it is here. I do question Chic Sales performance; he must be an acquired taste, but his presence turns out to be crucial to the plot. He&#39;s treated to special status in the credits, so Warner Bros. must have really been high on Sale, but how his corny old man routine fit in with the public then is something lost to me. Perhaps it is lost to time period, an unknowable factor you had to be a 1931 moviegoer to understand. Also, the climax is typically melodramatic. Nevertheless, this right now is the best release of the studio that year I have seen so far (however, I&#39;ve only seen eight, so perhaps that&#39;s an inconclusive view). Do not miss this when TCM shows it. 8 out of 10.&#34;

b&#39;Man with the Screaming Brain certainly isn\&#39;t a perfect movie, but I\&#39;m pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell, meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action, and happy endings. Campbell is, as a writer, uneven--there are lots of things in the story that don\&#39;t make a great deal of sense (why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it?), and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other, better incarnations (the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William battle for control of William\&#39;s body, is straight out of Evil Dead II). There are, however, lots of little touches and non-sequiturs that feel rather brilliant, such as when William is in the height of his panic and screams at a statue, &#34;What are you looking at?!&#34; The movie looks like a Sci-Fi Channel original, probably because it was. The acting is actually pretty good. I particularly enjoyed Tamara Gorski as Tatoya; she was ruthless and cunning, yes, but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored. Ted Raimi handled the standard &#34;bumbling assistant&#34; role admirably enough, and Bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending American jerk. (Now that he\&#39;s writing his own films, you\&#39;d think he\&#39;d give himself a role that he hasn\&#39;t been typecast in already.) Man with the Screaming Brain is a bizarre, nonsensical B-movie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously.&#39;

b&#39;Bergman is a sublime comedy director and writer. This fact becomes apparent in &#34;En lektion I k\xc3\xa4rlek&#34;, where the comic elements range from pure slapstick to deep, yet very emotional scenes. This movie is paves the way for Bergman\&#39;s later comedies &#34;Sommarnattens leende&#34; and &#34;Kvinnodr\xc3\xb6m&#34;, all of them starring Gunnar Bj\xc3\xb6rnstrand as well as Eva Dahlbeck. This is an excellent movie with which to start your Bergman experience, acutely portraying emotional troubles of the young as well as the old. The cinematography by Martin Bodin is astounding, for instance in the picnic scene. In short, the movie is a perfect example of a successful comedy, with a clarity of depth even surpassing some of Bergman\&#39;s own comedies.&#39;

b&#39;There is only one racist joke in this Daffy Duck short, which is basically, when Daffy rides Black Beauty, it is a black woman. I can understand partly why this joke was included, as at the time few people did not know how rude it was to be racist and it wasn\&#39;t even illegal to discriminate black people yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from this point, &#34;A Coy Decoy&#34; is basically a fun, interesting short where Daffy meets characters in books and does things in books. I liked this short quite a lot (despite the other reviewers on here). The way Daffy is so in love with the clockwork duck is vaguely disturbing, yet highly amusing at the same time. Porky is a nice edition to the episode, though it was not vital for him to be there. The wolf is an example of how people thought of wolves in those days as well, blood-thirsty, terrible animals, which of course they never really have been (unless they are very hungry). I also liked the style of animation used - and the theme of the episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who are totally into Daffy Duck and for people who do not mind the occasional racist joke in cartoons, enjoy &#34;A Coy Decoy&#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Available on YouTube.&#39;

b&#34;Wildman head counselor Tripper Harrison (Bill Murray in peak nutty form in his first lead role) presides over the various wacky hi-jinks at North Star summercamp. Tripper befriends sad and lonely misfit kid Rudy (a nice and affecting performance by Chris Makepeace). Director Ivan Reitman relates the amusingly off the wall comic vignettes at a ceaseless snappy pace and maintains an engagingly good-natured tone throughout. This film astutely nails the breezy&#39;n&#39;breezy essence of summer: making friends, first love, pulling pranks, competing in sports with a rival camp, campfire singalongs, and, of course, the inevitable scary urban legend about the escaped psycho killer with the hook hand. The sense of gleefully raucous fun this picture generates is positively infectious. Moreover, the humor is always goofy and occasionally gross, but never too nasty or mean-spirited. Best of all, there&#39;s a winning surplus of pure heart to go along with said humor (the warm relationship between Tripper and Rudy in particular is genuinely touching). The cast have an obvious ball playing their likable characters: Murray&#39;s gloriously gonzo and galvanizing presence keeps things constantly humming (his crazy PA announcements are absolutely sidesplitting), plus there are sound contributions from Harvey Atkin as hapless camp owner Morty, Kate Lynch as Tripper&#39;s sassy old flame Roxanne, Russ Banham as the amiable Crockett, Kristine DeBell as the sweet, foxy A.L., Sarah Torgov as the feisty Candace, Jack Blum as klutzy bespectacled nerd Spaz, Keith Knight as tubby slob Larry Finkelstein, Cindy Girling as the fetching Wendy, and Matt Craven as the hip Hardware. Donald Wilder&#39;s cinematography gives the movie an attractive sunny look and makes nifty use of wipes. Elmer Bernstein&#39;s lively and melodic score likewise does the trick. A real riot.&#34;

b&#34;Saw this at Sundance one of the first years I attended the festival - blew me away...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It went by much too fast, and I&#39;ve never been able to find it again. I figured it would show up on a compilation somewhere, but still no joy. My memory&#39;s foggy on the details - I just remember being surprised over and over again, and on the edge of my seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone reading this have any leads? Online, DVD, beat-up VHS copy - I&#39;d try to make it worth your while...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I&#39;ve probably seen over 200 short films (used to live near Aspen where they have an incredible Shorts Fest in April). This definitely ranks among my favorites, and I hope to see it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks to anyone with leads on how to see it :)&#34;

b&#39;What is often neglected about Harold Lloyd is that he was an actor. Unlike Chaplin and Keaton, Lloyd didn\&#39;t have the Vaudeville/Music Hall background and he wasn\&#39;t a natural comedian. He came to Hollywood to act; and he discovered he had a knack for acting funny -- first in shorts, then in features. He made a name for himself as &#34;Lonesome Luke&#34;, a Chaplin knock-off; with the &#34;glasses character&#34; that made him the all-American boy rather than a grotesque, Lloyd found his stride and his movies became some of the best produced during the silent era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He developed a reputation as a &#34;daredevil&#34; in some shorts, and retained this in some of his best movies (&#34;Safety Last&#34;, &#34;For Heaven\&#39;s Sake&#34;, &#34;Girl Shy&#34;). He was more popular than either Chaplin or Keaton during the twenties and he became very rich before the advent of sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first sound movies were often disasters. To get the most out of their &#34;sound&#34;, too much dialog was used in many movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lloyd\&#39;s acting skills were, after two decades, geared for silents. He didn\&#39;t have a bad voice; its high pitch suited his &#34;glasses&#34; character. And his sound films weren\&#39;t the unqualified disasters of legend. Yet silent movies had been raised to a high art (especially Lloyd\&#39;s, which did not stint on budget and were extremely well-crafted); with the introduction of talkies movies had to learn to walk again and they made some missteps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though he tried to move with the times and embraced sound, Lloyd\&#39;s best bits from his early (overly talky) talkies were still visual -- such as the scene in &#34;Movie Crazy&#34; where he appears to be riding in a swank car, but actually &#34;hitched a ride&#34; on his bicycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to recapture the daredevil antics that made him famous, as he did in &#34;Feet First&#34;, was misstep. (In &#34;Safety Last&#34;, his best movie and the one that, deservedly or not, shoved Lloyd in the box as a &#34;daredevil comic&#34;, he played a determined young man, climbing to the top. &#34;Safety Last&#34; had a natural structure that ascended to his character\&#39;s scaling the side of the building. He was obviously afraid, but his fear added to the humor. In &#34;Feet First&#34;, he arrived in a precarious building-scaling position by accident; his frantic cries for help detracted from the humor. His character was pathetic and cringing, aspiration to save his neck -- possibly an accurate statement of the 1930s, but not amusing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harold Lloyd was not mired in the past, like some wacky Norma Desmond. He embraced sound and tried to take his movies in different directions, growing and changing with the industry. When &#34;Feet First&#34; failed he left the daredevil business and made a satire on the talking movie industry, &#34;Movie Crazy&#34;. Just as he had to flounder through many movies as &#34;Lonesome Luke&#34; before carving his place in movie history with the glasses character, he had tried several directions in sound movies before hitting his stride in sound, which he did with &#34;The Catspaw&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &#34;The Catspaw&#34; he plays a missionary\&#39;s son reared in China who unwittingly gets elected mayor as a front for corrupt political interests. When he finds out the truth, he sets himself the task of cleaning up the town. Only in his early forties, Lloyd could still act the brash young man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet &#34;The Catspaw&#34; was another box-office failure, and Lloyd made only three more movies, including &#34;The Milky Way&#34;. Of his chief competitors, Chaplin still had silent movies in him and Keaton was hopelessly mismanaged. &#34;The Catspaw&#34; and &#34;The Milky Way&#34; suggest Lloyd might have mastered sound comedy if he had been a little younger, or if audiences had given him the benefit of the doubt after his early sound fiascoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the movie has been unfairly maligned about the way Lloyd\&#39;s character cleaned up the town, it suits him. From his days in &#34;shorts&#34; Lloyd wanted to scare his audience, and the climax of &#34;The Catspaw&#34; achieved it yet again, in a surprising way; until the trick is revealed it appears gruesome, and then come the laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Viewed as a product of its time, &#34;The Catspaw&#34; is charming and funny. A very well-written sound comedy, well-acted by Lloyd. Directed by Sam Taylor, its curious blend of drama and sly humor make it look almost like a Frank Capra or Preston Sturges comedy.&#39;

b&#34;Our America is multi-cultural, with so many sub-cultures. This movie simply tells a story of a snapshot in time within one of these sub-cultures. It is basically an objective look at a group of forgotten people, living their lives oblivious to the rest of the world. Generally, a good movie. It entertained, provoked thought, and showed lives that would not be seen otherwise, right in our own back yard. Should be seen by all. Having lived in the U.S. all my life, I had no idea that there were citizens here that didn&#39;t know they were citizens. This movie helps illustrate the diversity of our country by showing this small part of a southern state. The obvious conclusion: If this is really for real, then what else is out there that we know nothing of?&#34;

b&#34;I really liked this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has something to be blamed for, everyone is real. No paperboard heroes or cold, omnipotent, know-all characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read many others viewers here complaining about Anne morality and about James will to maintain his love for her, despite her cheating on him, but I don&#39;t agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Anne (Emily Watson) absolutely wonderful and I felt love for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was a heavily repressed woman, her actions were not planned: once she started to break free she was in confusion and did many errors. But so it&#39;s in real life, when you gain freedom you are likely to do errors (expecially at the start point).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was she a little too ungrateful? Maybe. But we must remember that she is running with her feet for the first time. She knows that James after all is a good man, maybe a little too stiff, serious and work centered; but she also feels the urge to live the life as herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is she to blame more than him? I think no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the turn happening into their lives generates some changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James instead of letting his wife go out of his life (as other viewers suggested as the right choice) bites the bullet and waits, hoping for the better. He starts to understand that what he superficially though was OK (his marriage) in reality was a control game played by him on his wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a story with characters having over-emotional and precarious nature (i.e. the usual clich\xc3\xa8 Latin American or Italian jealous guys), this is a story of men and women that use both heart and brain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be very painful but if you really love a person (women or man) and if you are not a terribly unstable nature, you are likely to forgive his/her cheating and let him/her go. Unless you are a jealous, prehistoric, crime-of-passion inclined, possessive and mentally instable individual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A really good movie. The last scene, when James - despite all the things happened before - goes with Anne to the train station is really moving: She is free and He understood what freedom means for a person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guido&#34;

b&#39;I finally managed to get myself a copy of Dario Argento\&#39;s Opera, and I tell you ... that was about time !! It was the last Argento movie I had yet to see and I\&#39;m a fan of most of his work. I reckon that most of his work is extremely important for the genre of horror but some of his movies tend to disappoint ( like Phenomena ). But the plot idea of Opera always appealed to me and it turns out I was right !! I enjoyed every shot in Opera and I was fascinated by this movie for the first minute till the last. Out of all the Argento movies, Opera went straight to the number one spot and I hope I can encourage as many people as possible to see this one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The script and plot-idea of Opera is rather simple. Especially compared to Argento\&#39;s previous movie Phenomena that had too many ideas in it, and ended up being a mess. The plot of Opera is creepy and chilling but at the same time it\&#39;s an excellent satiric comment - almost a spoof - towards the opponents of explicit violence. ***SPOILERS*** A young opera singer ( the gorgeous Cristina Marsillach ) is being stalked by a horribly sadistic murderer. During every massacre he commits, he forces Betty to watch his actions with her eyes wide open. There are needles attached to her eyelids and when she closes them, they\&#39;re getting torn apart. ***END SPOILERS***. To this simple - yet effective - idea, Argento adds a lot of horrific elements like ravens, the classic piece ( and curse ) of MacBeth and the whole atmospheric location of the opera building and the music. Especially the presence of the creepy ravens are and extra value. Ancient masters like Edgar Allen Poe already knew these black birds have a lot of mystery hanging around them, and Dario Argento knows it as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The violence and gore is very well presented in Opera and that\&#39;s what makes this a true Argento picture. His best in my opinion with Profondo Rosso as a close second. I surely hope to recommend this movie to a lot of people among you. Especially for fans of the ( Italian ) horror business, this is an absolute must ! Favorite &#34;Rewind&#34;-scene : Argento shows his visual talent the best in the scene where Betty\&#39;s friend is getting shot in the eye while she\&#39;s trying to see who\&#39;s in front of the door.&#39;

b&#39;Yes it\&#39;s a Fast Times wannabe, but it\&#39;s still decent entertainment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the comedy parts are really funny. The scene when the three guys visit the Spanish lady is hilarious, with a little flamenco music in the background. The reaction when her sailor husband comes home is a riot. The guys\&#39; exploits in dealing with crabs are funny as well when they try to &#34;drown them&#34; and when they visit the pharmacist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The abortion scene is a Fast Times ripoff too, but it does do a good job of capturing the terror of the situation. You really feel for what Karen is going through, and for Gary in his mad scramble for cash to pay for the abortion and accommodating her recovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending is painful to watch, but refreshingly realistic. First-time viewers will not be prepared for it and it will be a shock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a decent eye-candy for guys with young girls and the milf Spanish lady, but heterosexual guys will probably want to skip the penis-measuring competition. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underrated soundtrack too. Check out early, early U2(!), The Cars in their prime and an appropriate tearjerker song by James Ingram for the surprise ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people will hate it and it is somewhat dated, but those who like teen flicks or grew up in the early 80s should like it.&#39;

b&#34;Watched this flick on Saturday afternoon cable. Man, did it drag. I got the metaphors, symbolism, and all that stuff. No, I didn&#39;t care one way or another about the sexuality of the characters. But, the pacing of the story and the scripting almost put me to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is..... until Ruth Marshall got naked. If you&#39;re a breast-man who is not homo-phobic, you may want to rent it. Ruth has a lesbian sex scene that&#39;s pretty hot, and then a hetero sex scene that is a notch higher than most standard movie fare. Her jiggly D-cups made the film worth the watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The Mighty Avatar&#34;

b&#34;Dead Man Walking, absolutely brilliant, in tears by the end! You can not watch this film and not think about the issues it raises; how can you justify killing (whether it be murder or the death penalty) and to what point is forgiveness possible (not just in a spiritual way). Don&#39;t watch this film when your down! But WATCH IT!!!&#34;

b&#39;I can\&#39;t praise this film enough. It had a lot of that hand-held, first-person shaking camera which I love (and some hate, because it makes them sick), like REC, Cloverfield and Blair Witch Project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a long movie for its kind, but I didn\&#39;t even notice because the film was so interesting. By just showing the footage from a paranormal reporter\&#39;s work the movie keeps up the pace, making it a real-time experience for the viewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I would never call this film the &#34;scariest horror ever made&#34;, I\&#39;d have to say it\&#39;s certainly one of the best I\&#39;ve seen. The fear factor here is constructed by details in the images, camera glitches, events linked to one another which lend a very mysterious and haunting tone to the movie. The horror is more in what is not shown, but left to our imaginations. The ending is perfect, and be warned that you might have nightmares afterwards. A second viewing is highly recommended, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch this one alone in the dark, don\&#39;t expect anything and you\&#39;ll have fun.&#39;

b&#39;This has got to be one of the most magnificent things I\&#39;ve ever seen on film. I don\&#39;t know if it\&#39;s as serious as it seems to try to be, but that hardly matters. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and the marketing only make it more so because you *know* that ever so often some mother has to reprogram her kid to accept our reality after he checks this out from the video store expecting something completely different. Look at the roadmap, for one thing! And where else in America can you see a ten year old kid swear as much as this one does and then get his eye ripped out by pervert the rival of Pulp Fiction\&#39;s Zed? And that food inspector scene is the best! The amount of well known to vaguely recognized actors in this film is one of the best things about it: Soon, much sooner than you realize, you too will find yourself saying, &#34;Is that Meat Loaf? Is that Drew Barrymore? Is that the holideck doctor from Star Trek: Voyager? Is that Flea? Is that the sawmill owner from Twin Peaks gassing squirrels with car exhaust? And isn\&#39;t this guy from the new Rob Zombie movie? He looks an awful lot like Shrek.&#34; I think my favorite scene is at the very end, with Phil in a full body cast. I mean, please, why aren\&#39;t more movies like this shown in airplanes? This director hardly has anything else to his name higher than Return To Salem\&#39;s Lot, but he displays true stumbling man-child genius in this creation! If you\&#39;re an intellectual looking for something to p**s away your evening on, I highly suggest this film for satisfaction. This movie\&#39;s plot is all too ridiculous, but imagine it taken out of context: *boy arm wrestling an over aggressive Meat Loaf, who seems hell bent on taking out his anger at not being accepted into Guns N Roses, looks over his shoulder and sees the doctor from Voyager enter the bar* Can you imagine what any half brained channel surfer active through the last six years would think of seeing that? Now imagine if you actually cared about Meat Loaf or Voyager to begin with! Or imagine if you\&#39;re a Flea fan. Rocky Horror Picture Show fans, this film contains notable music, mind you, but its soundtrack is more plasticine than Mad Max 3. What does that entail for you? This is the retarded, inverted mongoloid cousin-sister-mother-puppy of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. How about when Gus\&#39; sleeve flies back onto his arm in an act of cable-access special effects quality mastercraft? When I saw this film, it was on the suggestion of my cousin who had watched half of it in a fit of half-aware childhood in the early half of the nineties and who has since been haunted by vague memories of it, I myself had not slept in three days. It made me laugh! Of course, it\&#39;s also an anxiety movie. The music doesn\&#39;t encourage the suspense but it eventually gets to the point where it\&#39;s been fully established that the American Censorship Committee has obviously missed this film entirely and absolutely anything can happen in it and probably will any time Gus turns a corner or the view so much as changes camera angles. I found myself obsessing over the possibility of those cards flying out his window at any second. Watch this movie. Awesome!&#39;

b&#34;You want a movie that&#39;ll take you places? Well this is a good pick. If you were an adolescent in the era portrayed in this film--the hayday of Motown--or if you want to reach back and see what your parents made so much noise about, I suggest you pick up this flick and give it a watch. At the risk of sounding cliche, you&#39;ll laugh, you&#39;ll cry, you&#39;ll reminisce and remember. You&#39;ll go back to a time when school violence was a fist fight. You&#39;ll recall with fondness your best friends from school. It&#39;s a feel good movie with an edge of angst and pain and realism--misconceptions, losing friends, deciding what to do with your life. I think everyone regardless of race, age, socioeconomic standing can pull something from this movie and really enjoy it. So take a couple hours out of a lazy day and check out this film; there are much worse ways you could spend your time.&#34;

b&#39;I have to say that I know the documentaries of Mister \xc3\x96rnek and so I knew that I will get a very well made piece of movie documentary. I was not disappointed. As a history nerd - I did saw hundreds of documentary and liked the different approach of this work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Director and his 17 Consultants (historians, Veteran families) tried to access the reality of the gallipoli through the letters of solders from both sides. So, the history is followed by British, Australian and Turkish soldiers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Narrated is this docu by Jeremy Irons and Sam Neill - both boost the intensity and emotionality of this documentary by their great voices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this film in a cinema in italy in Dolby Surround. I did buy the DVD last year and will wait again 3-7 years for the next work of this talented director and his very good documentaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Well made. Intense. History with emotions - wrapped in a war documentary with great narrators&#39;

b&#39;Driving Lessons From the writer of the critically acclaimed films, Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray, Jeremy Brock brings a touching heartfelt dramedy starring Academy Award Nominees Julie Walters and Laura Linney and from the Harry Potter series, Rupert Grint. The beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshall, (Rupert Grint) a seventeen year old boy being held captive in the heart of his religiously neurotic mother Laura (Laura Linney). After his school year ends he decides to take a job with a clever, free-spirited, and &#34;heavy on the bottle&#34; retired actress, Evie Walton (Julie Walters). The pair embarks upon wonderful adventures from camping to walks around the block to the simple conversations about life. Challenging the domineering mother, as well as each other along the way, the two develop a beautiful bond that revolutionizes both their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comedic elements are flawless and precise especially coming from the British veteran, Julie Walters. Brock uses his unique style to create an infamous and loving nature that first time directors could only dream. Directing comes naturally to Brock as he builds up stunning imagery that breaks the surfaces and plunges the viewer down into an overabundance of adoration and creation. Even the subtle score by unknown composers Clive Carroll and John Renbourn accentuate the tone and manner Brock had no trouble in generating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laura Linney is always making her mark in films as she does as &#34;Laura.&#34; The bossy and overbearing mother is at times unbearable and with Linney at the helm of it we are engulfed into that persona. The complexity of her character couldn\&#39;t have been more flawlessly portrayed by anyone else. Rupert Grint breaks away from &#34;Ron Weasley&#34; and tries on someone new. His performance is more responsive than loquacious but Grint gives us someone brand new to a child performance and the viewer gets to enjoy it. But the standout is coming from Oscar nominated actress Julie Walters who gives &#34;Evie&#34; a life of her own. Despite the role being clearly a leading one, Walters fairs better in the supporting category where I believe she can simply take home the prize. &#34;Evie&#34; is a mix of &#34;Clementine Kruczynski&#34; and &#34;Mrs. Laura Henderson&#34; with her free spirit and lovable persona. Hopefully her role will not go unnoticed this awards season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driving Lessons isn\&#39;t an &#34;out of this world&#34; experience but a fine, enjoyable one that any viewer could just kick back and learn a little something about life, love, and friendship coming in the forms of the most beautiful colors and sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: ***/****&#39;

b&#34;This is a great comedy, highlighting what it was like to live next door to racist bigot. But also shows that both main characters are actually as bad as each other. Based on the hit ITV comedy, this is very politically incorrect. And its all the better for it, comedy after all is to entertain. The movies only real drawback is there isnt much of a plot. However the cast are as great as usual. Jack Smethurst and Rudolph Walker make one hell of a team, playing off each other in a oneupmanship kind of way.It&#39;s been many years since i saw this movie and last week was finally able to buy it on dvd. The fact that the movie still contains genuine laugh out loud moments, means that i can recommend this movie, just like i would of back in the 1970&#39;s.&#34;

b&#34;This film was really a breath of fresh air from the load of Hollywood crap I&#39;ve seen recently. The acting is superb and the characters are engaging and oddly endearing. There really isn&#39;t much to the story, it&#39;s simple and it works well. An easy film to just sit down and enjoy. The mood was fantastic and the sets really helped push the movie along and offered some nice visuals. The film obviously has aspects of horror, yet is geared a little more towards the humorous side of things. You won&#39;t be laughing out loud hysterically with this one, but you&#39;ll be smiling the whole way through. The humor works very well with the characters and the superb acting doesn&#39;t hurt. I really watched this movie based on the fact that Ron Perlman was in it. His role is a bit smaller than I expected, but it doesn&#39;t matter; the rest of the cast does more than enough to keep you engaged. If you like horror, watch this. If you like comedies, watch this. Just go ahead and watch this anyway, it&#39;s really quite excellent.&#34;

b&#39;It was AMAZING. As a librarian and an attendee at the New York Library Association\&#39;s Vitality Fund Event on Thursday night, October 18, I was privileged to see a pre-release screening of the new movie, The Kite Runner. The release of the movie has been delayed because of concerns about the welfare of the child actors involved. I am grateful that the NYLA event was allowed to go on as planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the movie, I feel it was masterfully done. It had as much impact on me, I think, as Stanley Kubrik\&#39;s A Clockwork Orange, even though it is much less graphic - MUCH less. There is no comparison between the horrendous, shocking violence and rape shown in A Clockwork Orange and the small amount of violence actually shown in Kite Runner; only the subject matter and the implications for the human psyche are comparable. (I have written more details about the violence and child rape and how it was handled on my MySpace blog.) My overall impression was that this film was fantastic; one of the best-made films I have seen. The depiction of the Afghani boys flying their kites captured some of the beauty and grace of an art form unknown to most of the world. The subject matter is intensely serious, and the movie carries the emotions of the audience into that subject matter without many jarring &#34;Hollywood touches&#34; which have ruined other movies. Although the overturned cart of pomegranates was an obvious bit of symbolism (to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I must mention the excellence of the sound track. The recitation by the boy of poetry by Rumi as two main characters are fleeing the country during the Russian invasion - under terrifying circumstances - truly showed the power of those poems. I urge anyone watching to disregard the subtitles in that scene to the extent that you can, and just listen to the beauty of the language. I don\&#39;t even know what language Amir is quoting, whether his normal Dari Persian dialect is the same as Rumi\&#39;s original Persian dialect. Also, please note the sound heard every time a kite line is cut. I found it a profound, distinctive sound, though the librarians who were with me did not notice it at all. I can\&#39;t help but wonder if kites actually make a sound like that when they are &#34;cut&#34;, or if it gives a sense of the vibration/sound experienced by the kite flyer during competition.&#39;

b&#34;This movie has the look and feel of having been put together in a matter of days-kind of like Plan 9 From Outer Space. In spite of this, it&#39;s still a classic-ranking among my favorite Creature Features. *****POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD******* Count Dracula and Larry Talbot; aka Wolfman, arrive at the laboratory of Dr. Edelman seeking a cure for their nocturnal anti-social behavior, such as killing people. In the meantime, kindly Dr. Edelman discovers the body of the Frankenstein Monster. Becoming obsessed with bringing it back to life( a common character trait among scientists, mad or otherwise), he goes against his better judgement, resulting in monster mayhem and madness. One of the final Universal classics of it&#39;s time (Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein followed 3 years later), it rates a 10 with this reviewer. Onslow Steven steals the show as good doctor gone bad after being infected by the blood of Dracula and becoming a half- werewolf/vampire creature, coming to a tragic end. At 1 hour 7 min. it packs quite a punch. A worthy addition to my video collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: ***** out of *****&#34;

b&#39;I saw this film at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of avid movie buffs and Indian ex-pats. The film is amazingly beautiful and smooth flowing for a first film. The direction is self assured, especially with locals who were recruited on the fly for extras and bit parts. While the plot and story line is elementary to nonexistent, the pleasures of watching the performances and scenery offset the lack. The soundtrack to this film is a big attraction to world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done in 45 days, with a different location every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration. It was not disclosed in the Q &amp; A, but I imagine Hollywood could take a lesson in budget film-making by learning from this director.&#39;

A staid British gentleman calmly gets up from tea with Candice Bergen and drops three of them with a Webley revolver in his coat. A whisper from the ghost of Empire... Lest we forget! Lest we forget!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U.S. Marines coming ashore from the long, long gone _Brooklyn_. They were carrying Krags, it should have been Lees, but, oh wow. And the Winchester 97 blowing large holes in obstreperous natives and even more obstreperous and faithless Europeans... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raisouli --Sean Connery, o, Wow!--wondering \&#39;What kind of gun does Roosevelt use?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teddy Roosevelt--Brian Keith, o, Wow!--wondering &#34;What kind of gun does Raisouli use?\&#39; and writing yet another angry letter to Winchester about the stock on his Winchester 95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raisouli, armed with but a sword... A Prussian cavalry officer, HOLSTERING his pistol and drawing HIS sword... Honor. That\&#39;s something long dead, from a world long gone, but Raisouli would never have flown a plane full of children into a building...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milious at Milious\&#39;s magnificent best, and now out on DVD.&#39;

b&#39;William H. Macy is brilliant as Everyman caught in a desperate situation. Starts off with a bang and never lets up. Twists and surprises are fresh, unpredictable. Use of film noir clips and frequent quotes and references to 30\&#39;s and 40\&#39;s flicks makes this a delightful &#34;must&#34; for movie buffs.&#39;

b&#34;Recovery is an incredibly moving piece of work, handling the devastating effects of brain injury on not only the individual, but the entire family. Without resorting to preaching or Hollywood sappy endings, Tony Marchant&#39;s drama presents a family in crisis in a realistic way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highest praise goes David Tennant and Sarah Parish for their incredible performances. I had presumed before watching the drama that I would see some of their previous on screen relationship in Blackpool bleed through-- but it never does. Neither actor is recognizable from any previous work, and I didn&#39;t see either of them as an actor playing a part during the entire 90 minutes. In addition, Harry Treadaway&#39;s performance as the son just on the cusp of starting his own life in university was fantastic - throughout the piece, he shows the torn nature of a teenage boy thrown into the unwilling role as man of the house,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At times, nearly every character in the drama is unsympathetic. As the viewer, I wanted to give each of them a good smack to wake up to reality, stop moping, and start adjusting to the rotten but very present change in their lives. But under the same circumstances, I see myself acting like any of them - switching between trying to show the stiff upper lip to desperation to escape to anything, including behavior that is completely unlike myself. It&#39;s the show&#39;s greatest strength - truth, without sugar coating, to force us all to think what we&#39;d be able to do under the same circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a difficult, but must-watch show. I hope that it somehow manages to be shown in the U.S.&#34;

b&#34;I am awed by actress Bobbie Phillips and her superb skill as an action star! This movie is propelled by her wonderful acting and terrific action prowess. I am a fan of sci-fi but I must say that this film exceeds most science fiction films in it&#39;s cinematography and mostly it&#39;s utilization of an actress whose presence supersedes the plot which is fine but is nothing new. Even though it looks as though this film was made for television, in my opinion it is better than most theatrically released films of its kind.&#34;

b&#34;Ah! When good actors take on bland material! If you are thinking of this movie as a tight police thriller you may be disappointed. While the situations are very true to life, the plot proceeds at a very predictable clip and you can pretty well see what lays ahead way before the actors take you there. Many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just stereotypes in motion. Much of the dialog is just plain silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But! If you love to see good actors rise above this kind of material and make something of it, then you will LOVE this movie! Sam Elliott is nothing short of brilliant in taking the one-note character of Detective Falon come alive with depth and pathos. Those of you who have never seen Elliott emote that much beyond his usual scowling stoic stances will be delighted at the range of emotion he depicts in this film. And also, in his early fifties in this film, he looks fantastic! His bare chest scene gives hope to middle aged men everywhere! Esai Morales does a wonderful job elevating his role as Det. Falon&#39;s eager beaver new police partner. He could have easily played it as a Robin to Elliott&#39;s Batman, but instead he breathed a genuineness and passion into this role. He makes it work despite some of the lame lines he is given to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Sorvino is fun to watch! He plays the eccentric police captain. He seems to know he is slumming in this movie and is having a ball doing it. He makes it fun for us too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is very by-the-numbers in plot but makes up for it with great performances! Sam Elliott fans should definitely get this one as it is suck a kick to see him spread his wings and do so much more than he usually is allowed to do!&#34;

b&#34;Well I don&#39;t know much about anything, but I sure liked this film. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple, and heartwarming. In other words, it was everything it set out to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is set around a girl&#39;s first love, (as the title suggests) and I certainly should warn you: expect nothing challenging or provocative in terms of the subject matter here. I mean, it is a children&#39;s cartoon. It&#39;s really just a simple story, but it&#39;s told well, and it holds your attention well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end: it&#39;s short, it&#39;s funny, it&#39;s cute, it&#39;s simple, it&#39;s good.&#34;

b&#39;Altman and Scorsese have twisted sex together in one of the greatest American films of the past 20 years. Boogie Nights didn\&#39;t make a huge initial splash, and I still don\&#39;t think it\&#39;s received the credit it deserves. The immediate clamor surrounding the film (&#34;Some porn movie with Marky Mark&#34;) was wholly without merit. What Paul Thomas Anderson has created is no less than a stunning representation of the pursuit and subsequent loss of the American Dream (if such a thing still exists).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have been living in a box (or a confessional) for the past 8 years, Boogie Nights tells the literal rise-and-fall tale of young Eddie Adams (Wahlberg). Eddie is just a dopey kid from Torrance, California who wants something more out of life. His room is soaked in muscle-bound, naive Americana. His dreams are far bigger than his potential, but not quite as large as his...special gift. His bald-headed southern gent quickly raises the attention and eyebrows of the booming, omni-present adult film industry. Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds as the film\&#39;s twinkle-eyed Papa Bear) gets wind of Eddie\&#39;s hidden talent and decides to put him in a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you can say &#34;deep-throat,&#34; Eddie has changed his name to Dirk Diggler and exposed his massive member to a wide-eyed public. Fame and fortune make Dirk\&#39;s acquaintance, as do a bevy of local porn celebs. His friends and co-workers become his makeshift family, but it soon proves to be a Sunday picnic like no other. As the feel-good 70s give way to the coke-addled, video-friendly 80s, Dirk &amp; Co. begin a dangerous backslide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anderson put everything he had into this glorious, moving epic. It sizzles and never fizzles. Nary a frame of this monumental picture is wasted, and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after ELO fades from the soundtrack. See this one immediately. And then watch it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And again.&#39;

b&#34;I was swept into this series just as surely as the sea would sweep me into its grip. Although it started out slowly, I found that the realism in depicting the ship, the variety of characters and lively dialogue keep me watching. The protagonist was destined to be challenged, grow and change on this voyage and I wanted to be there for it. I was not disappointed. The series took you from humor to tragedy and everything in-between, often in the same scene, the same breath. There was a wealth of emotional overlaying, interaction and expression--relentless and compelling to observe. The movement of the ship added an almost fanciful component to the many scenes, making the characters ill one moment and adding humor the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edmund Talbot is a complex character, the likes of which we don&#39;t see often. We may know where the captain stands or Mr. Prettiman, but they are older men, set in their ways. Talbot was young and arrogant, still learning, testing himself and being tested. He struggled getting along with others and made mistakes like a real person would but had a heart that could be touched, that grew with each hard-taught experience. I appreciate the excellent characterization; it&#39;s too rare in movies and television.&#34;

b&#34;The movie is a starter to what really happened in Phenix City. I&#39;m a grandchild of the people who really lived the story. The truth never has come out to my knowledge. I have tried to find the whole story out but the people who lived it are still scared to tell it. Phenix City is still run by crooked people. Albert Patterson was not quite the saint the story wants you to believe. The story was filmed in Phenix City. It still has some of the famous sites in it that you see in the movie. The Colonal Funeral Home still looks exactly the same. But if you are wanting the real history of Sin City you have to visit us and find people willing to tell you about Ma beachies and her kindness. She didn&#39;t get the name ma for nothing.&#34;

b&#39;Relish every moment of this languorous spectacle with music to match (Mahler\&#39;s 5th is gorgeous, but listen to the vocal portion of the 3rd symphony so beautifully utilised in this film). There are many aspects to this film, but the main subject is the overpowering force of beauty, its spontaneous nature, absence of logic for love and adoration. I am also an ardent fan of Bogarde and believe he was rarely as wonderful (try him in &#34;The Servant&#34; however). Note: I recommmend multiple viewings.&#39;

b&#39;While watching a mundane modern movie (The Runaway Bride) with my granddaughter (age 22) she asked me &#34;Since you\&#39;ve been watching movies since 1938, what is the greatest movie of your lifetime?&#34; Boy! What a choice that is! It took me all summer of thought and relooking a some flicks before I made my decision. It is &#34;THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES&#34;. This movie has no flaws. It is one movie in which each one of the minor characters part and dialog is essential to the whole story. There is not a single part in the film which could be left out. The young girl\&#39;s fixation with her brothers lack of hands, the man coming home to young adult children who have grown up without him and with different ideas, the portrayal of a young man whose only responsiblity was as a soda jerk who became the leader of a group of men, and was awarded medals for his action. A women who must now adjust to the husband who\&#39;s life has been away from her for years. The realization of the folks who were in the safety of there secure homes of the sacrifices these ordinary men made in their behalf. The look into the life of loving and living with a man without hands. A parents first look and reaction to their son\&#39;s new deformities. A man used to making life and death decision in a instant, having to return to the way of plodding though a conservative bank\&#39;s loan structure. This is no sympathetic, tear jerking, heart strumming act. THIS WAS REAL LIFE! It could not have been portrayed any different. This, my friends, is HOW IT WAS!! This could easily be considered a documentary. In this day of color film, please do not be turned off by the black and white because it is one of the finest B/W filming, editing and directing you will ever see. The casting was perfect. If I could, I would make it compulsory for anyone taking history, film making, creative writing, sociology, family counciling or psychology to view and report on this magnificent example of the film makers art.&#39;

b&#39;When I was younger, this movie always aired on Friday night in the summer on Channel 40 (this was the years before Fox was a network and took over the programming). I always looked forward to it. I\&#39;d go grocery shopping with my parents, then sit down with my Swanson\&#39;s TV dinner and a Lady Lee Cola(the only time of the week I was allowed to drink cola, and enjoy. Sure, the script is predictably late 70\&#39;s (like Little Darlings), but it\&#39;s a fun movie, and I loved Rudy and Tripper. Bill Murray coasts with little effort in the movie, but he is charming. Gotta love Spaz and those taped glasses (pre Revenge of the Nerds). Chris Makepeace is pretty much the same character he played in &#34;My Bodyguard&#34; but he does it so well.&#39;

b&#39;&#34;Hey, I didn\&#39;t order no cab!&#34; &#34;Yeah, well you got one...&#34; What can I say about Hack...what a man among men. He was a heartened ex-cop turned cab driver with a heart of gold. If you were able to (and fortunately for America\&#39;s TV viewers...one person per week was) penetrate the cold, hard surface of Hack\&#39;s exterior, you got to see a caring man devoted to vigilante justice. The show was superb, I laughed, I cried, I smiled...all in the same episode. My arms would break out in goosebumps when our dear friend Hack would exit his cab in another dark alley...with nothing more than his fists...ready to avenge a wronged civilian. A smile would break out on my face when the screen showed me a criminal in a dark alley\&#39;s facial expressions when the Taxi of Justice\&#39;s headlights illuminated upon his face. Week after week I canceled my duties as president of the Klingon Association to bask in the warmth glow of Hack\&#39;s brilliance. I have never seen a better show, and I mourned the loss of one of America\&#39;s greatest treasures when the show was canceled. In other Hack-related news, I would like to announce to the world that my wife and I are expecting Hack Koen to come into the world in about three weeks.&#39;

b&#39;I just saw &#34;Everything is Illuminated&#34; at the Telluride Film Festival. This is a truly remarkable film. Very emotional, funny at times and heart-warming. Bring your handkerchiefs! For those of you who enjoy a movie that brings tears to your eyes, I\&#39;m reminded of the endings of &#34;Babette\&#39;s Feast&#34; and &#34;The Notebook.&#34; The stories were completely different but had that same emotional power to bring tears to my eyes, just as this film did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No spoilers here. The summary is, as IMDb describes, a young man\&#39;s journey to the Ukraine to follow his roots and find the village where his father grew up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialog is in English and Ukrainian (and Russian too, I believe). This allows for some wonderfully linguistically-based moments as one character interprets, more or less faithfully, for the English speaker in the group, depending on the circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scenery is wonderful and the musical score is a treat with wonderful Eastern European influences. Be sure you stay through the credits for the final tune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Lieve Schreiber\&#39;s directorial debut and is well done. I give this film a 9, one of the best films I\&#39;ve seen in a long time. I recommend it highly.&#39;

b&#34;This film is absolute gold. If you haven&#39;t seen it, do. Mani Ratnam outdoes himself once again. This film introduced me to Nandita Das as well, though everyone shines in this movie. My only regret is I&#39;ve never found a copy with subtitles to the lyrics of the songs. We are led from the jungle of northern Sri Lanka to the serene beaches of Southern India, as well as from the terror of war to the ultimate conquest by love of the human heart. Beautiful, subtle, witty, with a few hidden surprises waiting for the viewer, this movie stands up to being seen again and again, and the story within the story, The Umbrella, is done so well, as we watch the scene unfold from drawings in a book. Lovely. Watch it.&#34;

b&#39;I\&#39;ve never read a good review for &#34;Vanity Fair&#34; and I can\&#39;t understand why. For something that was &#34;rushed through in ten days&#34; it all comes off surprisingly well. Though admittedly &#34;Becky Sharp&#34; is a better movie and Miriam Hopkins a better Becky, there\&#39;s nothing to stop this one from getting a solid 9/10. At times, Myrna Loy might seem just too cute and nice to be playing an utter bitch, but at other times she just has to squint her eyes and the air temperature drops a dozen degrees. Meow! The move to a more modern setting did not work against &#34;Vanity Fair&#34; and the only thing that really causes some conflict is the casting. Barbara Kent (Amelia) was under 5 feet in height, and few of the leading men were very tall either - this all coming together to make Loy look like an absolute Amazon woman!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Vanity Fair&#34; is similar to &#34;Craig\&#39;s Wife&#34; in that no matter how bad the main character is, you have to love her. And you know she deserves her comeuppance, and then some, but you still feel sorry for her when she gets it. Though based on the same story as &#34;Becky Sharp&#34;, this version had a different ending, which is interesting to see because most of the rest of the films were almost identical. For pleasure value, the ending of &#34;Becky Sharp&#34; is ultimately more enjoyable, although aesthetically, and from the flow of the story, there is no doubt that the ending of &#34;Vanity Fair&#34; is the better one, whether or not you actually like it.&#39;

b&#39;Telling the story wouldn\&#39;t be the point at all, would it? Barnens \xc3\xb6, spelled almost like &#34;boon\xc3\xa9 aww&#34; is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that shocked a lot of people, including myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Children\&#39;s Island is the title, and what an island. In the book, Raine, the main character has The Guiness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he\&#39;s keen on breaking new records himself. In particular the youngest person under water for three minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is, as most Swedish films and books of the time, deep, consciously provocative and awe inspiring. Bergman was beginning his final film and Cries and Whispers was barely out. expectations for any Swedish film were pretty high. They taught us then that great theatre, great actors, superb writers and gifted directors made a veritable team of perfection in cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this said, Barnens \xc3\x96 is a story of discovery. It is, too, a story of alienation: cities are alienating and living in one of them make us aliens to most of its residents. It is a story of revelations and sudden encounters with our own destiny. It is a film of overwhelming hope and desperation. Of feelings buried under layers and layers of isolation and insulation from a world that couldn\&#39;t care less...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This approach, in itself, is a pretty difficult way to weave a convincing narrative. Here, the masterful guidance of Kay Pollak on Ola Olsson\&#39;s script of P C Jersilds novel, turns it not only in a possibility, but in one of those master pieces of cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may disagree a bit with someone who said that this work was all but forgotten. It is not. Even as I write this in 2009, discussions on P C Jersild\&#39;s story are conducted all over the world, and the film shown at many film schools and small theatres.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? Waxing philosophical on all of it would be difficult and many have already done it scholarly through writing and lectures. The reason why Barnens \xc3\x96 was and IS a special story is the cosy feeling you get from the start when you discover that everything is told through the eyes of a small child. And that\&#39;s where it ends, too. Maybe it\&#39;s a clinical view, as someone else pointed out. But deeply disturbing, moving and satisfying. The concept is deep: as long as we have no pubic hair, we still can live one more day as an angel. Afterwards, we\&#39;ll become what Raine reflects as the colophon of his experiences: &#34;Men are Pigs&#34;. He finds his fears when he\&#39;s fearless. He finds love when the world is crumbling around him. He discovers a reason not to behave like the grown-ups because he refrains from committing crimes. He let go his inner purity and confidence in others without reservation, just to learn how rotten the soul of a man can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where love is expected, he finds hatred. Where compassion is needed, he finds suspicion and cold hearts. It\&#39;s a film of metaphors. A film to think and to raise questions that are hard to ask but harder to answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the satisfaction of witnessing such a superb work (that really upped the ante for any other Swedish film after) is a ride of joy and hope. Be aware that it is a film full with the dark side of our nature. But, alas!, a film of hope and deep joy. Reine will still be an Island in Stockholm, but there is the big hope of living today in full, even when we found our first signs of sexual maturity show.&#39;

b&#39;Everyone\&#39;s favorite trio of bumbling imbeciles run amok in a hospital in this incredibly raucous and often hysterically funny romp. These guys are without a doubt the single most incompetent bunch of doctors to ever fumble their way across the screen. Comic highlights include the Stooges constantly breaking a glass pane in a door, their encounter with a deranged patient who claims that rats used to come out of the buttonhole of his shirt, the Stooges riding through the hallways on a giant bicycle, a huge horse, and miniature race cars, and our sublimely stupid threesome accidentally leaving instruments inside a hapless patient\&#39;s abdomen after they finish operating on the poor fellow. Director Ray McCarey relates the frantic comic shenanigans at an appropriately nonstop hectic pace and stages the broad slapstick gags with considerable gusto. Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Curly Howard are all in peak loopy form, with sterling support from Dell Henderson as long-suffering hospital supervisor Dr. Graves, squeaky-voiced Jeanie Roberts as a hiccuping nurse (the scene where the Stooges do an absurd impromptu group singalong with this gal is absolutely sidesplitting!), Ruth Hiatt as a whispering nurse, Billy Gilbert as the ranting crazy patient, and &#34;Little Billy&#34; Rhodes as a feisty tiny patient. The spirited lunacy never lets up for a minute, thereby making this beautifully berserk baby one of the Stooges\&#39; best-ever outings.&#39;

b&#39;In the history of cinema, every great film-maker had to create a first film. Many times when viewed after they have become a success, a light bulb goes on in our heads. The connection is made and we see the solid foundation from where they started. So it is with HORSES ON MARS. It is the subtle humor woven around a seemingly straight-forward narrative that tells a great story, but allows you to enjoy the visuals at the same time. In the imagery, I found great attention to detail and a production polish that is rare in any student film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A young film-maker always has improvements to be made. But if Mr. Anderson continues on this path, I think we will someday look back on this film as the beginning a great career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should definitely view this film. Nothing beats the grandeur of the big screen.&#39;

b&#34;I caught this movie at the Glenwood Cinemas at the weekend as part of the Kansas International Film Festival, which, as usual has provided a thoughtful and eclectic sample of world cinema. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been keen on Australian Film for a number of years, so was pleased to learn that this film was included, and I was certainly not disappointed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superbly shot, firmly directed, it&#39;s an eerie tale of one man and his journey to the heart of darkness, as it were. It reminded me a tad of Lynch&#39;s Wild at Heart, it has that strange madness in it, but I was glued to the movie for other reasons - namely that it presents a portrait of Australia which is..well, very believable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have vacationed to the Land Down Under a number of times, once in the 1980&#39;s and again about 7 years ago with my wife. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t wish to go to great lengths explaining my vacations, but the director Frayne appears to have a grasp on much that I find so odd and eccentric about Australia, a country that is responsible for the extremities of, say, Nick Cave on one hand, and Steve Irwin (the &#39;Crocodile Hunter&#39;) on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One incy wincy whinge - - I would have preferred even more of the &#39;unknown&#39; Australia. Much more in fact. But I also realise that there&#39;s only 1 and a half hours to do it all in... &#39;Sigh.&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, this movie is very, very accomplished.&#34;

b&#39;Edward Dmytryk\&#39;s &#34;Crossfire&#34; is a rare film coming from the Hollywood of the 1940s. This was groundbreaking territory for Mr. Dmytryk and the studio because of what the director and his adapter, John Paxton, decided to do with the novel, in which the film is based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven\&#39;t seen the film, please stop reading now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Brooks novel was about the killing of a gay soldier. In the movie, the subject matter was turned around to prejudice against Jews, a theme that was taboo during that time in the American cinema. It\&#39;s to Mr. Dmytryk\&#39;s credit to have had the courage to get involved with this film project, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is an outstanding piece of film making because the way the director presents it. Obviously influenced by the film noir style, we are taken to the Washington of the post war. The opening scene about the brutal murder of Samuels shows such unusual cruelty being inflicted to a decent man, who we don\&#39;t know yet, or why has been killed, but who didn\&#39;t deserve to die in such horrible fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basis of the murder is prejudice, pure and simple. We realize how in the mind of an ignorant man, the mere fact of being successful and different, plays in the mind of the assassin. Samuels stands as the sacrificial lamb, the same way the gay soldier is the victim in the novel. The parallels are well drawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film makes compelling viewing because of the brilliant star turn of Robert Ryan, as Montgomery. Mr. Ryan was an actor that always played interesting roles, but never so well as in &#34;Crossfire&#34;. Also, there is a great appearance by Gloria Grahame, as Ginny, the prostitute with her heart in the right place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the cast play as an ensemble. Robert Young, as the police detective in charge of the investigation plays is a decent man who has known prejudice first hand in his own family and speaks loudly against it. Robert Mitchum plays a cool Sgt. Keeley who is deeply touched by the crime when one of his men is accused of committing it. Sam Levene is excellent in his small role of Samuels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a film to watch because of it probably the first to speak out loud against ignorance.&#39;

b&#39;if filming is about vision and real life this movie is quite perfect: NUOVOMONDO talks about immigration in the USA from Italy the beginning of \&#39;900, but it speak also for now, when emigration/immigration is still a focus . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn\&#39;t to be rich to be a visionary film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acting at extra level, Charlotte Gainsbourg a star. A good challenge for the Academy Award 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After first Crialese\&#39;s attempt, &#34;Respiro&#34;, an emotional but too intellectual movie, this one has learned Fellini\&#39;s and Taviani\&#39;s lesson, to name just two Italian masters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot is arguing, directing accurate, maybe just a little less melodrama would be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If VOLVER ( challenging for Academy Award next year ) by Almodovar is a mature movie by an always brilliant director, NUOVOMONDO deserves it more, because of his good effort to be a European movie for the American scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is it!&#39;

b&#34;I&#39;m just getting the chance to dig into past Austen films, and I picked this up because Persuasion is, has been, and always will be, my favorite work by Jane Austen, and Anne Elliot my favorite Austen heroine. So it was with great anticipation that I popped the disc into my player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#39;t disappointed, either. I knew there were bound to be some draw-backs, so I&#39;ll state them, and try not to be too thick about them. Anne Elliot is the most introverted of Austen&#39;s characters; she is the least talkative and the least witty. There are passages in the book where Anne says nothing - only her feelings are described. This works fine in print, but how to successfully transfer this to the big screen? Short of doing thoughtful voice overs (which would grow tedious over four hours) you&#39;re left with a long succession of shots where the heroine says little or nothing, and must communicate all by her facial expression. This can leave the feeling that the film is slow, and lacking in purpose. If you need a more overt style of Austen, then certainly this film is not for you; but if subdued is more your style, and you tend to pick up on unspoken &#39;vibes&#39;, this will fulfill all expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Firbank (as Anne Elliot), is, thankfully, an actress whose face can convey much. She looked as I had always imagined Anne Elliot would look: not a knockout - Anne wasn&#39;t supposed to be the elegant one of the family - nor in her first youth - which is also highlighted occasionally by the lighting and make-up. What you see is someone who is very like Austen&#39;s character: someone whose appearance you might pass over once; but hear her speak, and look more closely, and she grows more attractive the better you know her. This is Anne Elliot, as brought to life by Anne Firbank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Captain Wentworth&#39;s portrayal is ably handled by Bryan Marshall. The bitterness is never apparently obvious (save at the concert scene); and, yes, I found it hard to believe he wound find Louisa Musgrove interesting as she was shown. But that is another point of Austen&#39;s book: he did not find her interesting, he TRIED to find her interesting, and, ultimately, failed (sigh of relief). So this, too, fits with Austen&#39;s original story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially liked the portrayal of Lady Russell, who I thought in the book was not portrayed as TRULY bad; this also comes out in this adaptation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is one film which closely followed the book; I could write much more about how faithfully everything was reproduced, but I&#39;d run out of space here. Charles Musgrove remained one of the most buoyant characters (good fun), Mary the most annoying (I was dying to have her just shut up - but I had that feeling when I read the book, too), captains and the admiral I thought charming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cinematography I thought a trifle stiff. There was little or practically no fade from one screen to another - perhaps this is due to it being a TV movie. One scene - CHOP! - the next scene, the actors enter from right, proceed left, and - CHOP! - another scene, where the same thing happens. This was the only part of the movie which I felt cheated me a little. A Low Budget has to show itself somewhere, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, as I said earlier, if you like some pace to go with Jane Austen, don&#39;t bother with this one, as you&#39;ll find it way too slow. I enjoyed it enormously, though, as it brought a wealth of detail (the sets were richly elegant!) to an excellent adaptation of my favorite Austen novel. I highly recommend it!&#34;

b&#39;&#34;The Honkers&#34; is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time. When we were shooting, everyone connected with the production figured that Slim was Academy Award material. Unfortunately, United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to &#34;The Honkers&#34;. I personally feel this film was under-rated by most critics. Sam Peckinpaw\&#39;s &#34;Junior Bonner&#34; was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us, too. The picture is worth watching, if just for the rodeo footage--some of the best ever filmed--shot by James Crabbe. The director and my co-writer, Steve Ianat, died a few weeks after the picture\&#39;s release, cutting short a promising career and leaving behind his lovely wife Sally, his daughter, Gaby, and newborn son, Stefan. Please give this movie a shot. I\&#39;m betting that you\&#39;ll say it was well worth while. I thank anyone who has taken the time to read this. Stephen Lodge&#39;

b&#34;First of all, I just have to say that I&#39;m a huge LOST fan. Everyone who makes the show, I love &#39;em. It&#39;s got everything in it, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m glad that they have great people making it, for instance Jack Bender is the greatest director, well, maybe after J.J. Abrams. And of course, full credit to Damon Lindelof &amp; Carlton Cuse. They&#39;re geniuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the season 2 finale is definitely one of the best episodes of LOST ever!!! Live Together, Die Alone focuses on Desmond David Hume&#39;s story of getting to the island, and Henry Ian Cusick is so great playing that character! The makers of the show would have been very stupid if they would&#39;ve let old&#39;Des die on us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in LOST, the plane crash survivors have been there for 65 days.. 65 days, man. Whileas Rousseau has been there for SIXTEEN years, and the Others have been there for God knows how long. Referring to Jeffrey Lieber, Lindelof &amp; Abrams. Anyway, I hope we&#39;ll get the answers we need, in season 3. Can&#39;t wait! My vote is nine.&#34;

b&#34;I&#39;ve discovered this movie accidentally and it was really a nice surprise. A Christmas Classic,it&#39;s also one of the fine comedies of the 40s. The story line is simple : Elisabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck) makes out her living by writing culinary columns for a magazine. At Christmas time, her boss, Alexander Yardley (Sydney Greenstreet) asks her to invite a young weakened sailor in the Connecticut farm she write about. The only problem is : She hasn&#39;t got any farm and she can&#39;t cook. To get out of the jam, Elisabeth agrees to marry a wealthy friend (Reginald Gardiner,who has a farm) and flies for Connecticut with her wonderful cook Uncle Felix. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s a fine direction by Peter Godfrey and the cast is really wonderful : Stanwyck has never been better as this witty and yet romantic woman. Greenstreet, Gardiner and Sakall make hilarious and human supporting characters. The only weak point is the leading man, Dennis Morgan. He starts well but as the movie goes on, becomes really a bore. One almost feels sorry for Elisabeht Lane to ends up with him rather than with Gary Cooper or David Niven who both would have been more suitable for the part. Anyway, this is a joyful Christmas time movie with a refreshing score and I advice it to everyone who likes to spend funny and sweet Holidays...in Connecticut.&#34;

b&#34;When I saw this on TV I was nervous...whats if they messed it up? Millions of families like mine that live with a brain damaged man, in my case my Dad, would be let down. I watched it with my Mum and we both ended up crying, it was so accurate and captured how the family feels as well as the person having suffered the brain injury. The actors were all wonderful and I had no complaints, my Mums told me she hasn&#39;t been able to stop thinking about it. I hope this program made many people aware of what it&#39;s like living with brain damage and what it&#39;s like for the families. More programs like this should be made, I was surprised at how good it was and it&#39;s really shook me up emotionally.&#34;

b&#34;I like The Wind and the Lion very much. It was a good movie. I thought that since I&#39;m young and it was made so long ago I wouldn&#39;t like it all that good, but after I saw it, i was amazed of how good it was. My family liked it, my friends liked it, everyone I showed it to liked it. I liked it because it showed how Arabs and people in Morroco was treated during the Early 1900&#39;s, by the Germans, French, and even the Americans. If I was a High School History teacher, I would definitely show it to my student&#39;s, From a High Schooler&#39;s point of view. I give this movie a good 10 out of 10. My grandparents liked it so much they bought it for themselves. My little 3 year old cousins even sit down and watched it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Systemoffell&#34;

b&#34;This is such a beautiful movie! Not only does it portray war, it also has friendship &amp; love. The life of Slama is filled with sadness, every aspect of his life fell apart. I can only imagine how he would feel when his friend make the ultimate sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a slight similarity to &#39;Pearl Harbor&#39;, which is also about two pilots falling in love with the same woman. However this film is much better made, because this does not portray the woman to be unfaithful &amp; easy-going. The friendship between the two men is also much more convincing &amp; well built-up. I definitely recommend this movie to all people.&#34;

b&#39;In a really neat spin on Hitchcock, Larry (Billy Crystal) and Owen (Danny DeVito) lead unpleasant lives: Larry\&#39;s ex-wife has gotten rich by publishing a book that he wrote, and Owen has the most overbearing mother imaginable. When Larry tells Owen to calm down by watching &#34;Strangers on a Train&#34;, Owen gets the idea that they should do criss-cross murders like in the movie. And just like in the movie, Larry thinks that it\&#39;s a joke, but Owen\&#39;s serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How they came up with the idea for &#34;Throw Momma from the Train&#34; I\&#39;ll never know, but it\&#39;s a hilarious movie. There isn\&#39;t a dull moment in it. And that ending was a hoot. Crystal and DeVito are at their best, and Anne Ramsey is as much of a hag here as she was in &#34;The Goonies&#34;. A modern classic.&#39;

b&#34;It&#39;s not a movie, but an experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the usual eye candy I thought it would be. Too many things are happening at once, your senses almost couldn&#39;t handle it. A product of cutting-edge technology (we were torn between just sitting back to enjoy the show and putting our 3D glasses on and off to decipher the magic), the music is great (it&#39;s a concert!), the Disney characters are in it (and you get to BE part of their world), it&#39;s funny, it&#39;s magical, it&#39;s exciting--I know this is beginning to sound like an advertisement--but it really is that awesome!

b&#39;Having finally caught up with this &#34;masterpiece,&#34; it strikes me that it must have seemed terribly clever, in its day. It\&#39;s French, arty, under-played to the point of agony, and ultimately downbeat. But viewed from the vantage of 37 years in the future, it\&#39;s also just a bit vacuous, pretentious and unsatisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have summarized the story, but I don\&#39;t think anyone has pointed out the dramatic flaw at the heart of this film: the lead characters, Corey and Vogel, really don\&#39;t deserve what they get. They play square within their code, never harm anyone who didn\&#39;t ask for it, and show great courage and initiative. Moreover, Corey in particular is victimized by his former gangland \&#39;friend,\&#39; who stole his girl and who repeatedly tries to have him killed, apparently just because he (Corey) dared to \&#39;borrow\&#39; a few thousand francs. These are guys who really ought to be due for a break! Instead, things go far worse for them than they really need to, within the logic of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One might contend that this is the whole point: that the real villains never get caught; that they collude with the police as needed, sell out their friends, and always come out on top. But that\&#39;s not shown either. Corey\&#39;s old gangster friend is not shown colluding with the police. Nor is he shown gloating over his victory. In fact, after materializing several times when he\&#39;s needed, he\&#39;s nowhere to be seen at the conclusion, leaving a dramatic tension (his feud with Corey) entirely unresolved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, I\&#39;d say this film is well worth seeing for its beautiful photography, its slow, deliberate pacing, its great deadpan performances, its elaborate heist sequence, and its encapsulation of the art-film style of the late 1960s.&#39;

b&#39;First I have to admit that I have had some doubts about the director. He has done some movies (with Jarkovsky) about the recent &#34;czech=east&#34; history or more precisely about families (individuals) how did they survive some historical moments. But it was always like the chines food sour-sweet. This movie was totally different. It was pure, it shows the bones of life, it shows the variations of human natures. This film is an excellent piece of art (story, acting, picture, music) but it shows you the life around you in much brighter light that we don\&#39;t want to see. By the way I have saw it on a DVD (with English subtitles) but I am afraid that in the USA I wont be able to get it.&#39;

b&#39;Dolemite is, for me, an object of my deepest affection. It\&#39;s got everything: a gang of karate-fighting prostitutes, Dolemite punching his fist through Willie Green\&#39;s (director Martin) stomach, high pumps and 100 gallon dalmation-print hats. Moore\&#39;s unique comedy raps, actually toasts, are close to the roots of hip hop. No wonder Dr. Dre mentioned &#34;Dolemite&#34; 3 times on his classic album &#34;The Chronic.&#34; Add the best list of characters to ever grace a movie, like the horny preacher, the hamburger pimp and, of course, &#34;the one who no one knows until it\&#39;s time.&#34; Credit should be given for style to director D\&#39;Urville Martin, a fella who probly doesn\&#39;t get as much attention as he should around film fan circles (I\&#39;ve been looking for a copy of his and Fred Williamsons\&#39; movies from the early 70s for years and can\&#39;t find them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people are really down on this movie and say it\&#39;s really bad, and it is true that you can see boom mikes appearing everywhere (look to DP Nicholas Josef Von Sternberg, for whom I think this was a very early effort), there are a lot of things going for this movie. Number one, there is no other movie like it. Number two, you get to see Rudy Ray Moore do a (highly sanitized; everyone who HASN\&#39;T seen Moore\&#39;s outrageous live act will have to use their imaginations) cinematic version of his toasts, plus him living the life of his comic book character superpimp come to life. The action scenes are pretty poor, but the characters\&#39; dialogue when they\&#39;re talking trash more than makes up for it. It\&#39;s full of strange little details (like the fact that the Hamburger Pimp is wearing a Dolemite T-shirt inside out -- was this intentional or did the guy just pick up whatever shirt was lying on the set and put it on?) that keep you coming back to watch it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;

b&#34;The idea of young girl, who gets pregnant at the age of 16 is nothing new to the drama genre. But it is pretty new if you take a look at the comedy genre. There is this basic plot of Lorelai and Rory, mother and daughter. Lorelai comes from a wealthy background, got pregnant with 16 and ran away from her parents&#39; house at 17. But this series does not start there, it starts when Rory is 16 and everything is just about the problems of a single mother, who has terrible problems with her parents and about all those problems you have when you are 16.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now again this sounds pretty normal, but there is this little thing called joke. The Gilmore Girls talk incredibly fast and they make like 60 jokes a minute. Even if you don&#39;t understand all of the jokes, since they contain hundreds of references to films, music, gossip, history, literature and politics. Sometimes you even get confused, but that really is the fun. And not only it is fast, it&#39;s smart and wonderfully sarcastic. In addition to that it is not only funny, it has great drama parts in it and you can take some lessons from it even home. Which is a thing that does not go for every single TV- Series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So watch it! It&#39;ll lighten your mood and help you through hard decisions!&#34;

b&#34;The violent death of Fernando Ramos Da Silva only eight years after the completion of this film, only adds to the poignancy of dierector BAbenco&#39;s powerful message. The film is split into two halves - the first in a reformatory where a group of youngsters are abused and violated by the violent law enforcers and guardians. The second backdrop is the city where they are confined instead by their own actions and morality, which includes mugging, pimping and killing different characters who enter their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The differing gender and sexual roles in the film allow for constant changes in the characters as they interact with other people. Particularly interesting is teh character of Lalica, a transvestite who is mother and lover to some of the children. Her reaction to the arrival of Sueli, a prostitute is both poignant and tragic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no happy ending to this story and i reccomend to watch it with caution as there are some very uncomfortable scenes to watch especially in teh opening twenty minutes. But whilst watching it, it is important to remember that this is not just a fictional tale. The actors are not trained professionals but instead boys selected from the streetsof Sao Paulo. They actually lived this life that is portrayed so vividly on screen and in da Silva&#39;s case, died at the hands of the police who are depicted so brutally. A documentary? A piece of fiction. It borders on both but it certainly makes for heart wrenching material and is a film that actually leaves you breathless and thinking long after having watched it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10&#34;

b&#34;The subject of children being terminally ill is difficult and saddening but &#39;The Cure&#39; successfully portrays the idea that it doesn&#39;t have to be all doom and gloom and, if anything, children need to have hope and delight in their lives if they are to find peace before the end. It is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film sees Erik, a dysfunctional adolescent boy with a distant mother, moving into a new area where their next-door neighbour is eleven-year-old Dexter, who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion. After his initial fears and ignorance over AIDS are allayed, Erik befriends Dexter and their almost fraternal friendship sees them embark on a journey down the Mississippi to where they have heard about a New Orleans doctor who claims to have found a cure for the disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The talent from the two young leads of Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello, who play Erik and Dexter respectively, is exceptional. Brad was able to portray Erik&#39;s harder edge without comprising the subtle childish innocence inherent to the character while Joseph depicts the sense of vulnerability to Dexter&#39;s character but injects the right amount of boyish enthusiasm and zeal to highlight that his illness doesn&#39;t mean he still isn&#39;t a child who wants to run and play like any other eleven-year-old boy. The pair&#39;s interactions create a feel in the audience that these are two boys who are genuinely close and they carry the film well. Annabella Sciorra also delivers a touching performance as Dexter&#39;s mother Linda, who adores her son and delights in seeing him thrive with this new friendship to Erik and eventually becomes a surrogate mother-figure to the other boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set against an excellent soundtrack, &#39;The Cure&#39; is a very bittersweet film that manages to flawlessly weave the story of boyhood friendship that survives unflinchingly in the midst of prejudice and terminal illness without resorting to sappiness or unnecessary saccharine sweet scenes. A very interesting reflection in the film is that is it the adults who have the problem with Dexter&#39;s AIDS status whereas the children, even the &#39;bullies&#39;, come to accept him as they would any other. What is also very touching is how, despite Erik&#39;s streetwise nature, he is the more naive one in his determination to cure Dexter while the younger boy has this haunting sense that he knows his fate but is swept away by his best friend&#39;s enthusiasm for a cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend &#39;The Cure&#39; for it is rare to find a film that is simultaneously sad and uplifting.&#34;

b&#34;Intelligent, nail-biting drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and soon was on the cover of every newspaper in America (when life imitated the film). A nuclear power plant employee in Southern California is threatened by superiors when he decides to go public with the real story behind an accident at the plant. Ostensibly a stuck valve problem, a TV news-crew&#39;s film shows that it was an accident verging on disastrous proportions--and worse, that safety conditions are being scrubbed to save millions of dollars, a cover-up that endangers everyone&#39;s lives. The movie occasionally gets too technical (especially in the second-half) and could use more human interplay, however the performances by Jack Lemmon, Jane Fonda (as a puff-piece news-woman in the right place at the right time), and Michael Douglas (as a freelance cameraman) are superb. The throwaway bits involving nuclear protesters is both entirely accurate and bitterly satirical, and the news-biz (with its corporate structure and vapid yes-men) is vividly captured. ***1/2 from ****&#34;

b&#34;The casting of Robert Culp is probably the only decent move the production team made with this film. Falk and Culp were marvellous, but as culp was not Falks nemesis this time, chemistry was lacking. Columbo is only as strong as his opposite number, and this time he didn&#39;t have one.&#34;

b&#34;Interesting tale of giant mammoth elephants running amok in modern India. Features transparent special effects-elephants dressed in shaggy coats sporting tusk extensions. All this said, we do have a good story and a fine cast at work, and an exciting climax. It&#39;s been said that the running time on this one was doubled when it showed in India-courtesy of Robert Lippert, a master at &#39;padding.&#39; Given a choice, opt for the shorter version.&#34;

b&#39;I saw this episode of Masterpiece Theatre and immediately came to IMDb to look it up. I was greeted by a comment from another user, who believed that it was nothing special, a 6 out of 10, and underwhelming. I would feel morally remiss if I didn\&#39;t disagree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am an avid fan of Masterpiece Theatre, but oftentimes the stories can be a bit silly on television, for example, &#34;He Knew He Was Right&#34; was absolutely horrendous. &#34;Carrie\&#39;s War,&#34; however, is probably the best I\&#39;ve seen so far. The entire cast does an excellent job, and it held my interest more than any other piece I\&#39;ve seen recently. The character Mr. Evans is of particular interest, and through subtle images of, for example, an untouched birthday cake or a garnet ring, my opinion of him went from bad to truly good. Truly. His ultimate demise, and the story of how everyone around him left him a cold hard man, is what brought out the bittersweet in this story for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end is gratifying in every sense but one; that everyone did not get what they deserved, but overall things worked out. I absolutely recommend this to everyone.&#39;

b&#39;I\&#39;m a next generation person...i\&#39;ve never saw the original doctor who but i have heard about the series that sparked a great fan base in the past and still making its mark in the 21\&#39;st century; the new &#34;Doctor who&#34; started in 2005 but for those that live here in the states like myself we pretty much see it as new episodes on sci-fi channel or BBC America; from season one we are introduce to a new player Rose Tyler (Billie piper) and a pretty cool new doctor played by Christopher Eccelson (misspelled last name sorry). these two go on some many amazing and very extremely dangerous missions to save the world...every now and then they have companions from rose\&#39;s ex-boyfriend mickey to the now ever present Jack harkness (who can now be seen on the spin off &#34;Torchwood&#34;). From season one to season two the pace is just about right...the stories can be from the outlandishly weird to the most action packed paced driven but either way its one rollercoster ride from the start of the theme song which is very catchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in season two he becomes different and changes and now the new doctor (David Tennant) continues the fight to save the world with rose and from this point there can be some that say some of the season wasn\&#39;t as good but i have to disagree and it was sad to see rose and the doctor part ways but it leaves the opening &#34;companion&#34; role to Martha (played by the very sexy Freema Agyeman) who helps continue the fight to save mankind...season three now is more on the action/adventure level and sometimes on the emotional but not as much as the first two seasons; here the relationship between the doctor and Martha is fitting but the attractiveness CAN be rushed into at times and the obviousness comes into play that she\&#39;s NOT rose Tyler being that you experienced her company in the first two seasons and not in the third season it can be a bit awkward it was for me cause you get use to rose and her ways and now to see someone who at times don\&#39;t really question the doctor on an emotional level but all the same makes the pace very exciting for viewers which keeps you at the edge of your seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all this is one thrill ride of a television show i would give it more but there are some flaws to this show as well that i can\&#39;t mention cause its sometimes hard to pick up but just one does which is the doctor and Martha\&#39;s relationship is rushed and not leveled on the get to know you base; I\&#39;ve seen good shows on British TV but this is by far one of the coolest sci-fi adventures for the old and new generation to experience but you don\&#39;t have to take my world for it...step into the tardis and join the adventure.&#39;

b&#39;Not only was this movie better than all the final season of H:LOTS. But it was better than any movie made for TV I have ever seen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the &#34;Top 250&#34; I see that only one small screen movie has made it: How the Grinch Stole Christmas. I think it is time to increase that group to 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than this, but I didn\&#39;t mind. I just LOVED being able to enter the world of the Baltimore Homicide Squad again!&#39;

b&#34;Last night, I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). Oddly, it was 137 minutes long--slightly longer than the time listed on IMDb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me. The context for what was occurring was missing and I am glad I stuck with it. At the beginning, a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding, war breaks out in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated. Months later, the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to India. At a refugee center, you see the lady about to give birth--after which the titles to the film finally are revealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire focus of the film then changes completely--to a young girl who is about to turn 9 in Madras, India. You see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family. None of this seems that interesting or important and you wonder what is missing--what about the lady who was about to give birth? My wife and I debated this and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the child of the lady in the first part of the film. Somehow or another, she had been adopted and was talking about her life with mom and dad #2--though she did NOT realize these people were not her biological parents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after this, the parents revealed themselves to be total idiots (one of the complaints I had about the film), as they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her parentage AND tell it in a way that left the girl emotionally screwed up and confused. Despite a stupid decision and telling her in the worst way, the parents made up for this by agreeing to help her find her biological mother. Seeing the impact all this had on the girl and parents (particularly the adoptive mother) was impressive to watch and sure sparked my interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Sri Lanka has been involved in a very, very long and brutal civil war with Tamilese militants, off and on, for three decades. The family&#39;s decision to look for the mom back in Sri Lanka was indeed noble, but also a bit stupid at times--as they took so many risks and nearly got killed again and again by just blindly jumping into the middle of a war! This was all exciting and captivating but also left me wondering about the sanity of the adoptive parents--first you tell her she ISN&#39;T your biological child and now you take her in the middle of a WAR ZONE!!! Sure, the kid really wanted to meet her biological mother, but this really was stupid in hind sight. If it were me, I might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and fool the kid--thus avoiding being in the middle of a war!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my complaints, the film was lovely to watch and was very rewarding. Far from perfect, it sure hits an emotional home run. Also, while I expected this because I have seen several Indian films, many Westerners will be a bit surprised by the vivid songs that seem to come out of no where--this IS standard in most films from India--including those made in Bollywood (Bombay) and Tamilwood/Kollywood (Madras).&#34;

b&#34;Ever since 1981, Nintendo has been making great video games such as Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years. Games made by Nintendo never seem to get boring because they&#39;re always adding something new. It went from arcade games to the Wii and I hear that there&#39;s a new version of the Wii scheduled for release in 2011. The thing that makes Wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I have more good news. Super Mario Galaxy 2 is to be released in 2010.&#34;

b&#34;I saw this in 1993 on a VHS tape but have been unable to find it at any source since. This is a very bleak and uncompromising look at the last days of the Japanese Army in the Phillipines. Anyone with an interest in the Pacific war would do well to view this film and see what conditions the other side fought under.From what I can tell, this is historically accurate, and depicts how easily men can descend into complete barbarism. I understand the Japanese Army was completely cut off from any re-supply in the Phillipines by 1945, so there is no doubt many of the horrific incidents depicted here happened. I might not have been able to identify with the film&#39;s characters, but I appreciate their humanity and struggle to survive. If I had to compile a list of the ten greatest war films, this film would be on it. See it if you can get it.&#34;

b&#34;I Loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. Can We expect more? Let&#39;s hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions. A Picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion. I hope some producer or director can get into the idea and bring us new comedy to our screens. we are needing a good insurgence of comedy to keep our level of laughter higher than ever before. A good Comedy FIX.&#34;

b&#34;We saw La Spettatrice at the Syracuse International Film &amp; Video Festival &amp; liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film delved into the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and most importantly fear of our own inadequacies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three lead actors, Barbora Bobulova as Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo are match well to their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to witness the dynamic between the three of them as it seemed real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe Barbora Bobulova is a stand out. I hope we see much more of her in the coming years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film doesn&#39;t take the easy way out. Thumbs up to the Italian team who put this film together. Highly recommended.&#34;

b&#34;George Scott gave the performance of a lifetime in Paddy Chayefsky&#39;s THE HOSPITAL, a very dark drama about an aging big city hospital and a middle-aged physician on the verge of suicide. Along comes Diana Rigg as a free spirit determined to save him from himself. Their dialog crackles, and it is clear they are made for each other from the outset. But will she save him? Their one sex scene is both graphic and memorable for its passion and fury. Meanwhile, the hospital is under siege by a group of agitators who don&#39;t want it to turn a condemned building into a cancer center. And a serial killer is loose in the hospital, specializing in doctors and nurses. A good part of the movie, though, is squarely focused on Scott. As it should be. What a difference a few years made back when this movie was made. 1962 had given us THE INTERNS, a hokey, old-fashioned reworking of DR. KILDARE with terrible acting and a cardboard script. Along came 1971 and THE HOSPITAL. Less than 10 years later. Hollywood did something right for a change. Watching THE HOSPITAL today is a reminder of how much medical shows like ST. ELSEWHERE and SCRUBS owe to this enduring classic. And if THE HOSPITAL reminds you of NETWORK, it should. Same scripter.&#34;

b&#34;It is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski&#39;s trilogy, it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite: view them in order, Blue, White, and Red, and consider them together as one complete work. It is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes: liberty, equality, fraternity, and each them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry. They are each well worth seeing independently, but I believe they are best seen as one work. Collectively, I would rate the trilogy as a 9; separately, I place each in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color red is most memorable in the third movie as a backdrop in a billboard ad, the profiled model of which is the central of the movie&#39;s three main characters. The other two characters do a double-take of a varying degree of recognition when they first come upon the ad, posted larger than life alongside a busy city intersection. This ad is not a major part of the plot of this movie, yet its image becomes striking and is one of the reasons I have called Red a `mind-bending&#39; film. This is the third of Kieslowski&#39;s Three Colors trilogy, based on the Blue-White-Red of the French flag and the three parts of its motto, `Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.&#39; The films stay primarily focused on these themes, keeping with the basic levels of one, two, or three main characters, yet with each film the complexity of plot escalates as the three principles move from fundamentally personal (Liberty, Blue) to relational (Equality, White) to social (Fraternity, Red). Red is my favorite of these films, and I give it a 9. It stands by itself as a great film, but one should see Blue and White first for the fullest effect.&#34;

b&#34;The best romantic comedy I&#39;ve seen in years. Not the kind of slick over the top Hollywood stuff by Ben Stiller or Adam Sandler and a lot less syrupy than a Hugh Grant epic. Julianne Nicholson and Jay Mohr are perfectly cast and both deliver smoothly professional performances as the engaged couple who decide to spend a little time sowing their sexual oats before marriage. Instead of playing it strictly for laughs the writers and director concocted a nice blend of human feelings and comedic action. Nicholson is just great as the awkward seductress and Mohr does a great job as the man who reluctantly enters into the game but soon finds himself enjoying his flings a little too much. We see just enough of the supporting characters to nicely round out the plot without distracting from the main story. Andy Richter (earnest friend) and Helen Slater (distraught single-mom) are particularly good. There is enough meaning and emotional complexity to make this a lot more than a standard boy-girl farce. Indeed, with just a little better pacing and a tiny bit more cutting this film would be a top ten comedy.&#34;

b&#39;Bullets may not have bounced off his chest, but The Lone Ranger was every bit the symbolic icon to me as my other boyhood hero - Superman. He represented truth, justice and the American way in a classic TV Western setting, living by the principle that he would never use his gun to kill, while scouring the American Southwest with his faithful Indian companion Tonto to bring every single outlaw to justice. The advent of TV provided the perfect opportunity for a post War generation to find it\&#39;s ideal in an enigmatic masked man who stood for law and order, while providing unparalleled entertainment for five seasons spanning almost eight years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I had the opportunity to view for the first time the complete three part origin episodes start to finish without the standard opening and closing sequences to interrupt the continuity of the story. For fans of the Ranger, this is the grand daddy of all Western sagas, telling as it does how Texas Ranger John Reid survived the ambush by the Butch Cavendish Gang, and how he was nursed back to health by an Indian friend from his childhood. Tonto (Jay Silverheels) declares his companion a \&#39;trusty scout\&#39;, and names him Kemo-sabe. I\&#39;ve read various interpretations of the origin of the term Kemo-sabe, but I\&#39;m satisfied with Tonto\&#39;s explanation. Reading too much into it just detracts from the story, just like the English translation of \&#39;tonto\&#39; from Spanish, which I won\&#39;t reveal, because it\&#39;s just better not to know if you can help it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it quite clever how the origin story created the mystique of the Lone Ranger, like the sixth grave that created the illusion that all the Rangers died in the box canyon ambush. You never see the face of the man who becomes the Lone Ranger, as it\&#39;s always turned away or obscured to hide his real identity. Even the origin of Silver is handled brilliantly; the voice of the story\&#39;s narrator describing the wild stallion\&#39;s sterling qualities. Would that relate, say, to sterling..., silver? I got the biggest kick out of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course with the passage of time, watching the Lone Ranger episodes today offers a view of how unsophisticated the show was beyond the origin story. Some of them are almost embarrassingly goofy, particularly when it comes to a Lone Ranger showdown when he shoots into the middle of a crowd of bad guys to knock a gun out of it\&#39;s owner\&#39;s hand. And how about that little wave he gives to Tonto whenever they\&#39;re about to ambush the bad guys - it\&#39;s always the same gesture, but Tonto always knows what it means in different circumstances. Then you have the episodes where Clayton Moore takes off the Ranger mask to don a different disguise to impersonate another character in service to the story. He even went under cover once as an actor portraying President Abraham Lincoln to uncover a villain, top hat and all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few fans that I come across ever know that actor John Hart replaced Clayton Moore for the 1952/53 season in a contract dispute that Moore had with the show\&#39;s producers. If you ever saw that &#34;Happy Days&#34; episode where Fonzie idolizes his boyhood hero, you\&#39;ll notice it was John Hart listed in the credits. It\&#39;s difficult actually, to tell if you\&#39;re watching a Hart episode or not, the key is to listen to the voice; Moore\&#39;s is so distinctive that it\&#39;s a dead giveaway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever get the chance to sample some of the final season color episodes, you\&#39;re in for a treat. The renditions I\&#39;ve seen on VHS are absolutely gorgeous, although I don\&#39;t know if commercial prints are available. Most of the black and white episodes around have been re-packaged by any number of distributors in different configurations, so getting your hands on those should be no problem. The must see of course is the three part origin, and if you don\&#39;t watch anything else, this gives you all the flavor and excitement you need to capture the imagination of one of the West\&#39;s most famous heroes. Hi-Yo Silver, Awaaaay!&#39;

b&#34;The Women is a cute movie about women at all ages (but mostly 30+) and their issues in life. Not just men and infidelity, but also about relationships with friends &amp; family, making time to connect with others, problems with image, compromising your values, accomplishments in life, and finding what will really make you happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s also about being true to yourself. A lot of times, people will give you advice but not really follow it themselves. Sometimes they have created a delusion for themselves, and should you really follow in that same path or react based on your feelings now? I really liked this movie. Granted, it was trying a bit to be like Sex &amp; the City at times, but that probably helped me like it. The difference here is it&#39;s kind of like the discoveries after the stage in life that the Sex &amp; the City stars were in -- here, most are married or past the point of trying to find a man. Now, they are trying to find happiness in their marriages and lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously it&#39;s not an Oscar contender, but it is entertaining and serves its purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the men out there, there were an equal share of men and women in the movie theater (most were with their wives/girlfriends), and the men were in fact laughing. :)&#34;

b&#34;I first saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) well over 25 years ago when I was very young. Being a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child, I loved to watch anything that starred Elizabeth Montgomery. This movie was (and still is) a real treat - whether you are a fan of Miss Montgomery&#39;s work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, such as her portrayal as the rape victim in A Case Of Rape and as the suspected murderess in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden. Her performance in The Victim as Kate, a terrified woman trapped in an isolated house during a storm, with a killer after her is brilliant. If you like exciting suspenseful thrillers than this is one movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat till the end. Another great performance well worth mentioning is that of Eileen Heckhart who plays the eerie and suspicious housekeeper. Unfortunately like most of Miss Montgomery&#39;s movies, The Victim is not available on DVD and I believe that although it was released on VHS some years ago, it is a rarity these days. I was lucky to have taped it when it was aired on television some ten years ago and so have a nice copy of this very good movie. A must see!&#34;

b&#39;If you have not heard of this film, it follows two Sudanese refugees from a refugee camp in Africa to America, where they convince themselves they will find success and riches. Life is harder than expected in the states, and this film beautifully captures the frustration felt when things are not going right. The lives are captured so well many moments seem scripted because they\&#39;re so perfect. Whether it be on the job, at school, or the time in between, the two boys, Peter and Santino, are very honest with the filmmakers, and make some very thought-provoking comments about life in the states. It\&#39;s one of the only documentaries I can recall that, when it ended, I wanted it to go on for another two hours. It might be difficult to find this movie cause it didn\&#39;t get great distribution, but check your local &#34;art house&#34; or independent theater and give this one a go (side note, if you\&#39;re reading this when it\&#39;s already on video then definitely it\&#39;s worth a rent). Rating: 28/40&#39;

b&#34;Overall I found this film good: exceptional acting with disturbing scenes (some essential, some useless) and weak second half. CONTAINS SPOILERS The film is divided in 2 parts. I thought the first half of the Pianist was terrific. We meet Erika Kohut (wonderful Isabelle Huppert), a piano teacher, and get introduced to her world. She is single, struggling to find her space against an over-protective and borderline tyrannic mother. We understand that she has lost or has seldom experienced love as a physical+emotional chemistry: she protects herself by being sharp and offensive to people, releases her sexual tensions in sex-shops, as a voyeur, or in sadistic self-mutilations ... This first half is very clinical and builds an incredible tension in the film, almost unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then comes Walter, a young, handsome and outgoing man (played superbly by Benoit Magimel). Though he gets to feel Erika&#39;s coldness in the beginning, he seduces her and slowly wreaks Erika&#39;s fortress. He loves her deeply but she needs him to fulfil her sadistic desires. Then when she is about to fall for him, he is disgusted by her world and in the end we discover that Erika is unable to love or feel at all (especially since Walter is portrayed as someone impossible not to love). This is the second half of the film, very touching as we see Erika&#39;s inability/inexperience to love lead her to self-destruction. This second half seemed less mastered by Haneke, and sometimes had non-credible (ie. too shocking) scenes which paradoxically lessened the drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, this is a crude film at least in the French version: you see porn sequences from the sex shop, daring mutilation and sex scenes. The much talked-about fellatio scene between Magimel and Huppert was quite good I thought, and is central to understand Erika&#39;s sick relation to love. As to the actors, Huppert is marvelous all through the film, Magimel gets better and better up to perfection, and Girardot (the mother) is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;

b&#39;Gregory Peck and Gig Young are competing for the same girl and after Peck sends Young on a very dangerous mission, they blame him for his reasons. Feeling guilty, Peck goes on an almost impossible task of defending a fort, where they are outnumbered by the Indians. Peck chooses for this mission soldiers which he considers to be the scum of the earth and the actors that play these soldiers, Ward Bond, Lon Chaney Jr., Neville Brand among others, are excellent. The script is derived from a novel by Charles Marquis Warren who was a specialist in westerns, as a writer, director and producer. The idea of using this type of men as heroes inspired many films that came out later including &#34;The Dirty Dozen&#34; made in 1967.&#39;

b&#39;Our family (and the entire sold out sneak preview audience) enjoyed &#34;The Guardian&#34;. Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters Ben and Jake. After seeing this movie, you can\&#39;t help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the USCG helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this is a fictional movie, it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit, dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual U. S. Coast Guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible. You actually felt like you were taking part in a real rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel the movie could have been made without the &#34;Hollywood&#34; bar scene (when you see the movie, you might agree) since the real Coast Guard does not condone such behavior. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very entertaining, very action packed, definitely worth seeing. Thank you, U. S. Coast Guard and the REAL helicopter rescue swimmers, &#34;So Others May Live&#34;. I\&#39;d highly recommend this movie to everyone.&#39;

b&#34;This is an excellent documentary about a story I hadn&#39;t heard about before. The first solo, non-stop sailing race around the world took place in 1968-69 and involved a handful of racers. It&#39;s a truly fascinating story about man vs. nature and man vs. himself. The story focuses on Donald Crowhurst, the tragic figure in this story. The film elegantly combines interviews with footage which was shot by the sailors themselves aboard their boats. The story is very suspenseful and sad as we learn the details behind the history of Donald Crowhurst. This is one of the best documentaries of the past few years. It has true human emotion in it as the men face this almost impossible task of navigating the world non-stop on their own.&#34;

b&#39;Alexander Nevsky is a series of superb sequences of cinematic opera that pass from pastoral to lamentation and end in a triumphal cantata. The story takes place in 1242. Prince Alexander Nevsky (Nikolai Cherkasov) defeats the Teutonic Knights in a battle on the ice of Lake Peipus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is a splendid historical pageant which shows director Sergei Eisenstein at his most inventively pictorial, and climaxes in a superb battle sequence using music instead of natural sounds. Several films have scenes strongly influenced by the Battle of Lake Peipus, including Doctor Zhivago (1965), Mulan (1998), and King Arthur (2004). Alexander Nevsky was kept out of circulation due to changing political winds, and then enshrined as perhaps the most influential Soviet-made historical film.&#39;

b&#39;Finding the premise intriguing, and reading the reviews, and being an Angel fan, I watched this movie. It\&#39;s sexy and original, and quite entertaining. David Boreanaz is Keith. He\&#39;s a hunky married man, stay at home Dad, and he feels a little inadequate in his marriage. He makes the mistake of penetrating a close circle of teenage girls who are fascinated with the idea of doing it with an older man. They\&#39;ll do anything to get into his bed, including beg, lie, and blackmail, but they mostly try to push his buttons. The nuttiness that ensues sends Keith reeling, and pushes friendships to the edge. David Boreanaz shows a little skin in this one-- and he\&#39;s looking hot. Yes-he plays a sleazy cheat - but he shows enough vulnerability and tenderness toward the goofy teens that you end up cheering for him in the end. One more thing, when someone moans &#34;oh yeah, oh..oh..YEAH!!&#34;, it\&#39;s hard to see them as a victim of rape.&#39;

b&#34;I am very impressed by the reviews I&#39;ve read of this film - generally well-read, thoughtful and informed - obviously by people who like and think hard about films. I couldn&#39;t add a thing to the excellent reviewing job that IMDb members have already done. If I may, I&#39;d like to correct a small but widespread misunderstanding that appears in many of the reviews: Mr Baseball was American and behaved in an ugly fashion but he was NOT an Ugly American. The original Ugly American was Homer Atkins, one of the heroes of the eponymous 1958 novel by Burdick and Lederer, and the exact opposite of Mr Baseball. Homer was an archetypal American, and an archetypal engineer - he went to Vietnam to work with people, he respected and liked the people he met, he used appropriate, sustainable technology in cooperation with his hosts, and he was liked and respected by them precisely because he exemplified democratic values and American virtues. His ugliness was purely facial, merely skin-deep; his personality and his humanity were deep and genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr Baseball exemplifies all the crass, ignorant, insecure boorishness that we Europeans and Americans so often inflict on other cultures; Homer Atkins, the Ugly American, was the other side of our coin, representing our humanity and decency. I believe that the Ugly Americans still far outnumber the Mr Baseballs; they are still our last, best hope.&#34;

b&#39;I have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect. And it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie. I mean you just have to love Robert Duval , Marlon Brando , Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie but specially Duval. I can not believe that Kramer vs. Kramer did win an Oscar in stead of this amazing war movie. So this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie ( The Godfather ) and the best of Hollywood actors you can only succeed. Now I just have to writhe something to get this preview so do not read this except the last line. This movie rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&#39;

b&#34;i happen to love this show. Its a refreshing take on some older sci-fi feels and styles. they aren&#39;t afraid to shoot, and when they do people tend to die. Far too many show&#39;s are afraid of this and end up just pointing the guns and then having it be a standoff. Farscape also comes complete with a large amount of heartwarming characters. They all grow on you till the point where it confuses you to hear them discuss taking some of the animatronic ones out of their box&#39;s to make the mini-series. From beginning to end farscape leaves you with a feeling of hope, and dispair, as new and unexpected things happen and then people live and die, surprising you every time. Worth a watch even if you don&#39;t have the time.&#34;

b&#39;&#34;North &amp; South&#34; the television mini-series is to the 80\&#39;s what &#34;Rich Man, Poor Man&#34; (the first-ever TV mini-series) was to the 70\&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a fabulous adaptation of the first classic novel in the trilogy from author John Jakes. The story itself covers the two decades leading up to the years of the election of President Abraham Lincoln and the imminent proclamation of the Civil War - North versus South. The intertwining stories evolve around the families of the Hazards (the \&#39;North\&#39; in the title) and the Mains and their two central figures of George and Orry who form a friendship whilst embarking on their West Point training in 1842.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;North &amp; South&#34; is a wonderful historic timeline and as I have grown older (and wiser!) it very much interests me to learn about the contrasting attitudes to such controversial aspects as \&#39;Slavery\&#39; and \&#39;Abolitionists\&#39;, and how these attitudes originated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The series also portrays some great characterisation development as we get to know about the friends and enemies in George and Orry\&#39;s lives, and also the women that stole their hearts as young men. This aspect of the story also uncovers a romantic tale that is set to the turbulent backdrop of the American Civil War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;North &amp; South&#34;, along with &#34;Rich Man, Poor Man&#34; is overshadowed by 1977\&#39;s &#34;Roots&#34; as the greatest mini-series of all-time. However, it does come a close second/third and also shares the same kind of timeline and themes as &#34;Roots&#34;. But, don\&#39;t let this one get away, even if it\&#39;s just to see the great scenery, costumes, and brilliant all-star cast including Gene Kelly, Johnny Cash, Elizabeth Taylor, James Stewart, Olivia De Havilland, Lesley-Anne Down et al. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The series is beautifully crafted and is firmly tied to actual historic events and it\&#39;s a pity the Emmys and Golden Globes didn\&#39;t honour a lot more of the actors and actresses for their portrayals. Patrick Swayze and James Read, the two virtual unknown lead actors at the time, turn in compelling performances as Orry Main and George Hazard respectively. However, it\&#39;s Kirstie Alley\&#39;s riveting performance as George\&#39;s \&#39;Abolitionist\&#39; sister Virgilia that steals the show many times. Plus, Terri Garber, David Carradine and Philip Casnoff as Elkanah Bent are the delicious villains of the piece you just love to hate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;North &amp; South&#34; Books 1 &amp; 2 are now available on two DVD sets.&#39;

b&#34;On one level, Hari Om is a film using a familiar genre - the road movie - to tell a familiar story: curious Westerner explores the mysterious East. But at its heart, the film is about two people, a young French beauty (Isa) bent on experiencing life to the fullest and a motorized rickshaw driver (Hari Om) with Bollywood aspirations, from vastly different cultures, their slowly growing attraction for each other, and the beautiful mad chaos that is India today. The gap between them can never be bridged, but the director succeeds in bringing the two as close to the brink of an affair as possible without damaging the story&#39;s plausibility. India and its people are essential ingredients of the narrative, and except for the main characters, the roles are played beautifully and persuasively by locals recruited during the film&#39;s production while on the road between the Indian towns and villages that form the film&#39;s setting. One major negative for this viewer: a Keystone Kops chase near the film&#39;s conclusion as Hari flees mobsters bent on collecting a gambling debt. But the closing scenes where Isa and Hari bid farewell are poignant and unforgettable.&#34;

b&#39;I quit watching &#34;The West Wing&#34; after Aaron Sorkin quit writing and producing. It just wasn\&#39;t the same. Imagine my thrill at seeing a film that he wrote again. It has been a long time - The American President, A Few Good Men. His script was a beautiful blend of humor and tragedy. He made a compelling story believable, and made me weep at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Hanks was incredible as a small-time Texas Congressman whose constituents only wanted lower taxes and to keep their guns. Not a hard job, so he had plenty of time to fool around - and that he did. His office staff looked as if he were at the Playboy Mansion. Like he reportedly said, &#34;You can teach them to type, but you can\&#39;t teach them to grow tits.&#34; Despite his sexist attitude, which fits right in with a Texas Congressman, they were fiercely loyal, especially his aide, Amy Adams (Junebug &amp; former Hooters girl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, add a rich Texas socialite who wants something done in Afghanistan, played perfectly by Julia Roberts; and a pain-in-his-boss\&#39;s-ass CIA agent, superbly done by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and you have a movie well worth watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding writing, and superlative acting, and a story that needed to be told. What more do you want at the movies?&#39;

b&#39;This is a cult classic for sure!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is tricky to follow at times, but then again, so is a film like Jacobs Ladder or even say Fight Club. If you want standard fare, then i figure go rent the Care Bears Movie or perhaps an old Disney classic. But if you want &#34; to view the world differently&#34; then i would say open yourself up to Enigma\&#39;s and for that matter to a film that challenges what we see and think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the key is that the film was original and had me questioning throughout. So while i have seen some complaints, all in all i would say take the film for what it is and enjoy.&#39;

b&#34;I am a huge fan of the $5.50 DVD bin at my local WalMart. Hopefully you have one at your local branch. You can find a bunch of campy flicks, a bunch of trash, and the occasional surprise. This movie is one of the surprises. My friend recently bought this one, and in thinking it would be another cheesy kung-fu laugh riot, I was genuinely surprised at how good it was. I watch a lot of movies, and as a result, I can almost always call how a movie will turn out; and if there&#39;s a plot twist, what it will be. Not this movie! The directing is brilliant, the plot is awesome, and the fighting is unbelievably inventive. If you see this one sitting around somewhere at a dirt-cheap price, get it! If you see it at full price, I would still recommend it.&#34;

b&#39;I like this movie above all others. It is &#34;multi-layered&#34;; there is so much to see and appreciate. Every viewing brings a new appreciation of the story-line, the plot and the characters. Faultlessly acted and extremely enjoyable if you take the time to watch it and appreciate it. I love the interaction between the players; the subtle relationships; the period atmosphere. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly cast as the brooding lover and Geoffrey the wronged husband is beautifully underplayed by Colin Firth. The scene in the sand storm where Catherine &amp; El-masy are discussing the different types of sand storms is one of the high-lights of the film and where the affair really starts. The other relationship between Hanna &amp; El-masy is yet another &#34;layer&#34; of the movie which is totally enchanting (and heart-rending). A worthy winner of so many awards.&#39;

b&#34;This movie is one of the funniest I have seen in years. A movie which deals with death and funerals without being depressing, or irreverant. Christopher Walken provides much of the comedy in this charming romance and I could hardly breathe for laughing so hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw the movie a preview, and when it was over, the audience not only applauded, but cheered. I am telling all my friends to watch for it&#39;s arrival in the USA. I definitely plan on seeing it again in the theater and purchasing it on DVD as soon as it&#39;s available.&#34;

b&#39;The third film I got to watch at the philly film fest was this outstanding drama from Japan. After breaking out of prison nine escaped convicts plan to find the &#34;key to the universe&#34; that a tenth convict who didn\&#39;t break out told them about. Along the way we get to know each of these men fairly well. Each has their own dreams. For much of the movie it seems to be mostly a comedy, but a shift takes place that the film ends up a tragedy. All of the actors give great performances. I can\&#39;t say much more without spoiling the film, but suffice it to say that you end up feeling for some of these individuals. At 2 hours, this film is a tad to long, but good none the less. I have no qualms recommending it with the warning that it does have a bit unsettling violence for the tender-hearted. Toshiaki Toyoda hit a home-run this time out, and it makes me want to search out his prior films as well as look forward eagerly to his future ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: A&#39;

b&#34;Farscape - is the one Sci-Fi Show which restarted the Interest in Science Fiction in me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Farscape is so much more then plain and simple Sci-Fi. Comedy, Drama and much more :) The Acting is very good. Luckily Farscape survived also it&#39;s cancellation and showed with Peacekeeper Wars that it is not dead yet :) I hope there is a future for Farscape :) In my opinion it is also not problematic that some of the characters in the Show are muppets. You have to look behind that and you will see what a beauty Farscape is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Farscape set a new Standard in Television and i think it will be truly hard for new shows to prove that they can be equal or better than Farscape.

b&#34;I could never imagine I would start loving movies like this. After seeing Yimou Zhang&#39;s &#39;Hero&#39;, I decided to check his other movies, perhaps looking for something similar. The second Yimou Zhang&#39;s movie I watched was &#39;No One Less&#39; after which I realized what kind of cinema I&#39;m now in. No wonder why I got &#39;Keep Cool&#39; immediately. It is a simple, touching and brilliant piece of cinema, I pay my respect to the director.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie shows that it&#39;s not the amount of money makes film good. It&#39;s all about what the director wants to show and how successful he is in doing this. The story is very simple, a typical extract of a typical daily life, moreover shown in a very simple way, the movements of camera also strengthen the impression and the feeling of the movie. I give a top rating to this film and impatiently waiting to see other Yimou Zhang&#39;s films.&#34;

b&#34;Flawlessly directed, written, performed, and filmed, this quiet and unpretentious Danish film is an example of cinema at its best, and if a person exists who can watch BABETTE&#39;S FEAST without being touched at a very fundamental level, they are a person I do not care to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is quite simple. In the 1800s, two elderly maiden ladies (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) reside in remote Jutland, where they have sacrificed their lives, romantic possibilities, and personal happiness in order to continue their long-dead father&#39;s religious ministry to the small flock he served. One of the women&#39;s youthful admirers sends to them a Frenchwoman, Babette (St\xc3\xa9phane Audran), whose husband and son have been killed in France and who has fled her homeland lest she meet the same fate. Although they do not really require her services, the sisters engage her as maid and cook--and as the years pass her cleverness and tireless efforts on their behalf enables the aging congregation to remain together and the sisters to live in more comfort than they had imagined; indeed, the entire village admires and depends upon her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, however, Babette receives a letter: she has won a lottery and is now, by village standards, a wealthy woman. Knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to France, the sisters grant her wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly French meal for them and the members of their tiny congregation. The meal and the evening it is served is indeed a night to remember--but not for reasons that might be expected, for Babette&#39;s feast proves to be food for both body and soul, and is ultimately her gift of love to the women who took her in and the villagers who have been so kind to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is extraordinary in every way, meticulous in detail yet not overpowering in its presentation of them. As the film progresses, we come to love the characters in both their simple devotion to God and their all-too-human frailties, and the scenes in which Babette prepares her feast and in which the meal is consumed are powerful, beautiful, and incredibly memorable. There have been several films that have used food as a metaphor for love, but none approach the simple artistry and beauty of BABETTE&#39;S FEAST, which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and which proves food for both body and soul. Highly, highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer&#34;

b&#39;Another enjoyable Warner flick. I really liked John Garfield in this, though I\&#39;m wondering why Cagney wasn\&#39;t in the role. Perhaps it was too similar to ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES? I mean, it\&#39;s another Dead End Kids story of sorts too, but I really appreciated them here and this film had a lot of nice comical touches along with some good serious drama. The boys work great with Garfield. A nice sequence was the whole &#34;swimming&#34; scene which starts out with no cares but winds up coming too close to disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative comment: Claude Rains was grossly miscast. As the detective, the fine actor seemed as out of place here as a nun in a whorehouse.&#39;

b&#34;My curiosity and patience to finally see this controversial film, which now has been released on DVD for the first time in the UK, has been more than rewarded. Peter Watkins has excelled himself in his audacity and technical skills. This pseudo-documentary is certainly ahead of its time and still frighteningly relevant and up to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is inspired by the upheaval of the late sixties in the US, when the government has increased its legitimized use of violence and oppression, while the anti-war movement reacts increasingly violent and radical. In order to deal with both this, the overpopulation of prisons and to provide special training to riot police units, the government has introduced the so-called punishment parks. Convicted &#39;criminals&#39;, mostly activists, are given the &#39;choice&#39; to either be locked up in prison for years and years, or spend three days in one of these parks, where they either gain their freedom their death or an even longer prison sentence. The situation in the parks is beyond their worst expectations, however. It reminded me of a sort of realistic version of Battle Royale (2000).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film&#39;s structure is extremely effective and recalls parallels with Cannibal Holocaust, which is made almost 10 years later. Both movies are constructed and filmed in such a way that the viewer is challenged in thinking and feeling he is actually watching a real documentary and therefore shocked, even though aware of the fact that: this is a film. Both confront us with the inherently violent nature of mankind, but where Cannibal Holocaust is devoid of any deeper meaning (above all, it is an exploitation movie in every sense of the word) and does not raise any critical questions about the state of the world, Punishment Park does just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been profoundly impressed with Punishment Park and find it hard to believe how such a powerful and important film could have been rejected and marginalized for so long. Maybe that says enough about the truth of its content, about the way power structures in this world function. I do not agree with the critique that Watkins polarizes and stereotypes, because the movie depicts activists and the keepers of the legitimized power structures who are in reality as polarized as they are here. If they weren&#39;t, there would not be any conflict and therefore no change in our societies. In reality, confrontations between these two groups often take stereotypical forms, whether you place them between activists and establishment in Latin America, Russia or New York City. If these groups would not be polarized to these extremes, the activists would be part of the silent majorities that tacitly complain but at the same time reside in the injustices of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Peter Watkins tells us in the introduction on the DVD, the actors in Punishment Park are for the most part amateurs. Most kids were real activists from LA, most policemen had been part of the national forces and even some of the members of the tribunals are part of the social and political establishment of the time. Not introducing both groups previous to the shooting of the scenes taking place in the improvised court room, adds to spontaneous and improvised feel. Parallels are drawn with issues of the time, such as the repression of Black Panther members (one of the black prisoners is said to resemble the convicted charismatic BPleader Bobby Seale) and the trial of the Chicago seven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admire Watkins&#39; obvious and sincere engagement with injustice and his concern with human rights and the increasingly repressive measures taken by governments (nowadays in the name of the War in Terror) to silence those that do not agree and refuse to be brainwashed. Punishment Park remains to be an extremely important movie that should be shown in schools and seen by everybody who shares these concerns. Maybe its marginalization can finally be made up for.&#34;

b&#34;This movie is hilarious, bright and insightful. Though perhaps the story would work well involving almost any ethnic group, the inherent Jewishness of the characters gives extra meaning to the bounty of wonderful dialog. There were so many social issues covered in the plot that for that reason alone it would have been worth seeing; -but the real treasure was in the warm laughter that spread throughout the appreciative audience. The medley of complex characters with their various strengths and weaknesses play out their roles with all the pathos and humor one would expect from the Shakespearean drama their lives seem to parody. This is a film about family; - about the often fragile, sometimes invisible binding together of diverse personalities and lifestyles, first among siblings and parents, and inevitably among the larger family of friends and even strangers. The technical aspects of the film have given the movie a pace and development that keep the viewer intrigued until the final scene. Peter Falk is amazing, as always, in his role as family patriarch Morris Applebaum. Strong performances by a fine cast include a surprise guest. Don&#39;t miss this movie!&#34;

Anyways, i actually enjoyed Haggard and i think it\&#39;s really like no other movie i\&#39;ve ever seen. It\&#39;s sort of in it\&#39;s own category.&#39;

b&#34;When i watch this movie i too get excited when seen bed scenes of miss world. She has beautiful and charming body. When cute lady do bed scenes and show her fully nude body... i think male have hard to resist....i think its time for cute girls like hrishita bhatt also do nude scenes. At least no one wants to c nude body of ugly women like Seema biswas to c in bandit queen.I concur with what mallicka.b has said. The movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content. Emotions aren&#39;t conveyed properly. I guess a couple of not-so-good performances also contributed to its mediocrity. In my view, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her scenes, she looks a bit lusty, which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed. I also noticed a bit of over-acting in some of her scenes. I&#39;m a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai :) Can&#39;t help it; sorry for that. &#39;Raincoat&#39; was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; I was not at all impressed&#34;

b&#39;Well, first of all - i am a big fanatic of horror movies, but however - I am pretty sick of all those damn American horror movies. They are all about the same thing - blood and violence. It\&#39;s not even creepy. Well, it\&#39;s nothin wrong with the blood and all that - doesn\&#39;t even bother me - but that\&#39;s not what makes a movie creepy! That\&#39;s why I find this movie entertaining - it\&#39;s fun to see a satire which is making fun of the koncept &#34;main horror USA&#34;. American splatter/gore-movies, they are not suppose to be creepy, only funny. That\&#39;s OK. But when they\&#39;re suppose to be &#34;creepy&#34;, it mostly gets pathetic. However, there are a few great american horror movies (Poltergeist, Psycho, Birds), but in the end it\&#39;s all the same thing. That\&#39;s why this movie came as a relief. Evil Ed is not just a cult movie - it\&#39;s a classic! I can\&#39;t wait untill master director Anders Jacobsson makes another goddamn splatter movie! Untill than I have to watch Evil Ed again - and again - and again! But I don\&#39;t care - it is such an outstanding movie!&#39;

b&#34;The movie is made in a style that resembles Lock, stock and two smoking barrels, with lot&#39;s of subplots, fancy camerawork, cool music and that great tongue-in-cheek Aussie type of humor you&#39;ll find nowhere else. How this movie has escaped the European and American audience is a mystery!&#34;

b&#39;It\&#39;s really good to see Van Damme\&#39;s film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to C-grade flops &#34;Derailed&#34; and &#34;Second in command&#34; which were both tragic and not in a good way. The Sheperd: Border patrol is a good action flick with some really great action/fight sequences. It\&#39;s good to know that Van Damme still knows how to kick seeing as his last film &#34;Until Death&#34; had no martial arts in it at all!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this film is significantly inferior to &#34;Until Death&#34; which was a really good turn for Van Damme. &#34;Until Death&#34; lacked the over-the-top action of most Van Damme films but was dark and gritty and Van Damme\&#39;s performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film. Still, The Shepherd is definitely a film worth checking out especially for Van Damme fans or just action movie fans in general but if you\&#39;re looking for a film with a bit more story line.....you may want to skip this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe that this film was done well enough especially on what little budget it would have been shot on. The only real problem I have with this film is the title; &#34;The Shepherd&#34;? I don\&#39;t get it! I suppose &#34;Border Patrol&#34; just doesn\&#39;t have the same ring to it without the word &#34;Shepherd&#34; in front of it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating for this film is 7 out of 10 but that\&#39;s by Van Damme movie standards not in any other film category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i.e. It\&#39;s good for a Van Damme film.&#39;

b&#39;A nicely paced romantic war story that should have got more exposure. The Czech pilot who played piano gives a mellow touch to the story. The flying footage may not have been enough for aviation buffs like myself, but then again, this really isn\&#39;t an action movie. Though it does not have anything in common with the James Salter novel &#34;The Hunters&#34; that became the movie about Korean War F86 Sabre pilots, Dark Blue World had a similar feel but with more of a romantic element to it. Better in some ways than Battle of Britain in that it doesn\&#39;t rely on big name actors. Suggest viewing this movie with some Czech beer and some Czech dumplings called kneldniky(sp).&#39;

b&#39;&#34;Big Fat Liar&#34; comes as a welcome -- shallow, but welcome -- breath of fresh air after one too many films featuring bathrooms, bodily fluids, pets on acid, gaseous jokes and crotch gags. After all, &#34;See Spot Run,&#34; &#34;Max Keeble\&#39;s Big Move&#34; and &#34;Snow Dogs&#34; had signaled The Degenerative Spiral of Kiddie Movie-making. Worse is the realization that the young audience would later be satiated by the smuttier offerings of &#34;Not Another Teen Movie&#34; and &#34;Slackers.&#34; Written by Nickelodeon producers Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins (who coincidentally co-starred on the \&#39;80s sitcom &#34;Head of the Class&#34;), the film stars Frankie Muniz as Jason, who\&#39;s always ready with a good lie to get out of scrapes. (Where\&#39;s the English paper? Dad choked on a Swedish meatball.) His teacher (Sandra Oh) issues an ultimatum: Turn in the paper by the end of the day or take summer school. Jason whips out a story called &#34;Big Fat Liar&#34; and is struck en route to school by a limousine carrying insensitive Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Wolf gives him a ride, but Jason leaves his paper behind. No one will hear the truth this time, and Dad tells him he\&#39;s lost his trust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months later, Jason and best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) see a movie preview for &#34;Big Fat Liar,&#34; and head off to Los Angeles to wreak havoc on Wolf\&#39;s life -- all to get a confession that he stole Jason\&#39;s paper to make the film. They even gain the sympathy of some of Wolf\&#39;s abused employees, including his assistant (Amanda Detmer), former chauffeur (Donald Faison), movie star (Jaleel &#34;Urkel&#34; White, playing himself) and stunt coordinator (a much-aged Lee Majors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because &#34;Big Fat Liar&#34; is without the edge that his sitcom &#34;Malcolm in the Middle&#34; is known for, Muniz is easy to root for but doesn\&#39;t have much to work with. Likewise for Bynes, who headlines her own Tracey Ullman-like sketch show on Nickelodeon. All the hamminess is given to Giamatti, whose eyes bulge and cheeks wiggle with every sneering insult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film gets snaps just by attempting the high road, and should be enjoyed by its target audience (especially since most of the high jinks occur on the Universal Studios lot). But here\&#39;s one head-scratcher: The message is that it pays to tell the truth. But didn\&#39;t we just see Jason getting to his payback by telling white lies throughout the film? Well, at least there\&#39;s no poop.&#39;

b&#39;This movie is excellent. Not because it does anything special or new, but because it is consistently great in all of its parts. No part stands out as being &#34;ground-breaking&#34; or &#34;stellar&#34;, but all parts are far above mediocre, and that makes, to me, an excellent movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own several copies of this movie, and may acquire it on collectors DVD or Blu-Ray, someday (holding off right now due to high blu-ray prices, and of course the face that I don\&#39;t have a blu-ray player... but that\&#39;s beside the point of this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stars off sort of ordinary, but quickly turns into a drama filled with tension, some action, strongly portrayed characters, and a well though out plot which keeps you interested until the very end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait, no, it does NOT start out ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts out sort of like what a Qun. Tar. movie WISHES it could be. With an awesome scene where an attempt to buy coffee and a donuts goes... very, very wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the movie, nothing was as it seemed, and a few people are dead, and a few people are very rich. I won\&#39;t tell you who... watch and enjoy! Overall rating: 10/10, A**, Excellent!&#39;

b&#39;Ted Danson was a great choice to play Gulliver. Even though his background was mostly comedy, he shows here that he can do drama just as well or perhaps even better (though there is a lot of humour in this). Hard to turn a blind eye to his American accent especially since his character is supposed to be English but that\&#39;s just a minor thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the villains are equally well cast: James Fox, Edward Fox, Peter O\&#39;Toole, Warwick Davis, John Standing, etc. Despite the fact that most of them are either tiny people or giants, they are 100% believable in everything they do and their motivations are very clear e.g. the Lilliputians\&#39; unremitting suspicion of Gulliver, Grildrig the (giant) dwarf\&#39;s hatred of him for usurping his position as court jester, Dr. Bates\&#39; attempt to have Gulliver proved insane so he can marry Mary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Steenburgen is great as Mary Gulliver (another 17th Century English character with an American accent but never mind). She is a deeply tormented character because she has been waiting nine years for her husband to return home and when he finally does, he is talking about tiny people, giants, a flying island and talking horses! Mary, despite the strong fantasy element in the story, is a very believable character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The special effects are breathtaking especially when you consider that it was filmed on a television scale at a time when CGI was in its infancy. It looks very realistic when we see a 6 foot tall man walking through a city filled with people who are 6 inches tall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cameos are great as well: Omar Sharif, Richard Wilson, Sir John Gielgud, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ned Beatty. All great actors who create a strong supporting cast that complement Danson\&#39;s superb acting ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Houynhnhms and the Yahoos are probably the most effective element of the story on the satire side of things: a society of talking horses who do not possess any of the vices that humans have while the Yahoos are primitive, disgusting humans who mate forcefully and appoint their leader depending on how disgusting he is. Gulliver and Mistress\&#39; study of them is also very well done and displays the differences and similarities between humans and Yahoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best version of &#34;Gulliver\&#39;s Travels&#34; by far and one of the best mini-series ever.&#39;

When mom and dad both lose there jobs, not to mention they have green slime in their bathtub. They decide it&#39;s in their families best interest to move to Oregon. Once there everything goes wrong. An interesting cast of characters compliment this movie. Including a young Molly Ringwald,this a movie I would definetly recommend.&#34;

b&#34;This is a film that has to be taken in context. It shouldn&#39;t be seen unless you&#39;ve seen the first two films, but the sort of people seeing this film will probably own the box set, or at least know someone who does. And you shouldn&#39;t go in expecting Blade Runner; the films budget doesn&#39;t stretch quite that far, and it&#39;s a far more zany ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially the film is a science fiction set in future Yokohama (shot in Hong Kong as is obvious) about a society where it&#39;s illegal to procreate. Sho Aikawa reprises a similar role from Dead or Alive 2 and Riki Takeuchi is a detective for the birth control cops. Takashi Miike isn&#39;t one to give all of his reasons to you on a platter, but one can assume that the law on procreation (enforced by giving people the pill) is there because of over population, increased life spans and so forth. Interestingly the dialogue in the film is mainly Cantonese, whilst Sho and Riki (who play their parts, as always, brilliantly) speak Japanese, and a few speak English. People have criticised the English as being wooden, but I found no problems with it. Also, another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive; said that Takashi Miike was anti-homosexual. He may very well be (and not all artists have to be left-wing), but I can&#39;t see this film as an insult to homosexuals. He merely calls back philosophies of ancient Greece when homo or bisexuality was more common. The film contains similar proportions of action-packed and poignant moments to DoA 2, although in this film the action is more martial-arts based, and are done in a very good Hong Kong style. The cinematography in the film is very nice on the eyes, with symmetrical shots, a good control on colours to give the air a polluted look, and it&#39;s nice to see uncut, lengthy shots that are so rare in Hollywood these days. Basically, there&#39;s a lot to like in this film: a good sense of humour, exciting action and some very beautiful moments. It&#39;s a great finish to the series. You could criticise it for being a bit cheesy, but isn&#39;t that part of the charm?&#34;

b&#39;In this tale of a tightly wound Christian family that has three of its four members &#34;born again&#34; after a cake-caused car crash, what really stands out is how grounded most of it is, where there is so much potential to go over the top, and how truly inspired most of the acting is. Where most of the film\&#39;s moments, particularly its frank and &#34;innocent&#34; discussions of sexuality after three of the four family members have their guilt and shame removed, is hilarious, it is also thought-provoking and the characters stay with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How often, for example does a character in a comedy spin from near caricature to full-bodied emotional being in the course of one scene? How often do we see a cast that can pull back from showboating mid-sentence, in order to show a bit of the humanity beneath the character\&#39;s skin? Even many of the &#34;bad guys&#34; in this film have moments of heart-breaking honesty, even while much of what they do can be absolutely ridiculous and horrifying. There is truth and history behind even the most questionable acts in this film, which is a difficult task in satire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How refreshing it is to see a darkish comedy that can dare to be humanistic. How nice to see actors so fully committed to character that they can dare to let them be ridiculous and sublime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a gay person, I do not think I have ever been quite so touched by a heterosexual sex scene as I was by the first sexual encounter between the parents of this family after their accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo. Bravo. One of my favorites at Outfest this year.&#39;

b&#34;I had heard of John Garfield, but, didn&#39;t know him. I loved this movie. I had never heard of it. I just picked it up randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He had been in real life also so he knew his part. He was a fugitive throughout the movie. Someone else killed a man. He character was blamed. He is befriended by a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to make of him. All sorts of minor plots ensue. My favorite was the scary swimming scene in a water tower where the water was deep and one Dead End Kid couldn&#39;t swim, AND none of them could get out.John&#39;s character saves the day. The Dead End Kids were great as his friends and followers. One of them right to the very end. Ann Sheridan played the family&#39;s daughter and John&#39;s eventual love interest. She was believable, but not lovable in my opinion-the only weak link in the movie.&#34;

b&#34;This movie is a mystery. It&#39;s not scary, it&#39;s spooky. You&#39;ll probably jump at some points and for some of it you&#39;ll be scratching your head to figure it out. It unfolds its mystery through the main character Eve and her psychotic college project at an insane asylum, Don. He needs her to search for some clues to vindicate himself from murdering his mother, and once Eve agrees to help him, she completely opens up pandora&#39;s box and unleashes some very strange things, including Malachi. I won&#39;t go into Malachi, but I thought the way that played out was complete genius. I know movie buffs won&#39;t regard this movie with the same prestige as other classics because it doesn&#39;t have anyone very famous in it (Angelina Jolie&#39;s brother was excellent, but maybe he should have asked his sister to show her face just so this movie could get some recognition) but I do think the way the Malachi ending works is something to talk about. I&#39;ve recommended this to my friends, definitely worth the purchase or rental price.&#34;

b&#34;Sherlock Holmes films from the classic Universal era tend to range in quality. This range goes from very good to above average, with none of their output being abysmal, or astoundingly brilliant. Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon fits snugly into the middle ground quality-wise, and, as ever, it&#39;s an enjoyable outing that fans of the series, like myself, will enjoy very much. This film sees Holmes in the middle of a World War 2 plot by the evil Nazi&#39;s to steal a Swiss scientist&#39;s invention, which could turn out to be a key element on the battlefield. The World War 2 Sherlock Holmes films don&#39;t tend to be as good as the ones such as The Scarlet Claw where Holmes is conducting private investigations, as they&#39;re usually dogged by too much propaganda or a plot that is more to do with the war than the mystery. This one, however, pretty much stays away from both and by putting the focus on Holmes and his investigation, the film works much better. Perhaps Universal saw what brought down the earlier Voice of Terror and changed the focus because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basil Rathbone once again puts in an excellent maverick performance as the ace detective and while Nigel Bruce doesn&#39;t feature as much as normal, it&#39;s nice to see him when he does. The two don&#39;t spent much time together, which is disappointing because their chemistry is always one of the best things about Holmes films; but this does allow more time for Holmes to showboat in various disguises, which is always lots of fun. Dennis Hoey&#39;s Lestrade is definitely my favourite of the secondary characters, and while he&#39;s not as funny as usual; his facial expressions are great, and his presence helps to emphasise how great Holmes is. His scene with Watson in a car following paint drops on the road is my favourite moment of the film. It&#39;s good to see Holmes&#39; nemesis, Professor Moriarty return, even if it does seem like he&#39;s just been thrown in for the hell of it. Lionel Atwill&#39;s performance isn&#39;t as good as George Zucco&#39;s in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, as he never really convinces that he is indeed a brilliant mind; but seeing him lock horns with the protagonist is fun and it&#39;s nice to see him in the film to offset the World War 2 themes, which are never as interesting as Holmes himself. The film starts off as more of a thriller than a mystery flick; but once it gets going, it&#39;s hard to put down and this is a more than solid entry in Universal&#39;s oeuvre.&#34;

b&#39;This movie, based on a true story of Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I\&#39;ve seen on race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson of the turmoil of 80\&#39;s South Africa. I put it in on the scale of American History X as far as it\&#39;s depiction of how a young man can get seduced by the Aryan doctrine and how the &#34;certain&#34; segments of the Christian church taught a false doctrine regarding race to justify an injustice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s strong message of forgiveness and redemption, is one of rarity in films today. The violence is well done as to show the severity of Gerrit\&#39;s crimes and greatness of his transformation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word about Jan Ellis who played Gerrit Wolfaardt. He carries you through the darkness of Gerrit\&#39;s beginnings to his enlightened transformation. He went to some dark places as an actor and is to be commended on his performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another standout performance was that of Mpho Lovinga who plays Moses Moremi, one victim of Gerrit\&#39;s crimes. He was able to pull from some places of pain that really touched you as you watched his performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good movie to show the teens.&#39;

b&#39;Gamers: DR is not a fancy made movie, it\&#39;s more like amateur video. Horrible magic effect, really fake fireball, terribly made dungeon, castle, village...... sword, axe, shield, robe, plate..... okok... everything. You will need about 10 minutes to adjust your expecting on visual, then you will get 105 minutes of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m from Hongkong and it\&#39;s really hard to find RPers, none of my friends play RPG and I always fancy to be one of the character in the world of D&amp;D. Watching Gamers: DR just show me what would it be like to be a gamer. You see rule books, dices, game set, etc etc etc; You hear terms like &#34;fighter&#34;, &#34;wizard&#34;, &#34;hit point&#34;, &#34;level&#34;, &#34;character&#34;, &#34;flaming hand&#34;, &#34;Chaotic Evil&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What RPG fancy me is that it let you do anything u want to, not bonded by software RPG. Gamers: DR provide the same element, you wont know what happen next and it probably just make you laugh to dead. The movie goes both gamers\&#39;s real life as well as in the D&amp;D world. You will hear the gamer cast the dice when the character in game take action, which make you feel you really participle in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t want to spoil anything, but in short, Gamers: DR is a must watch movie for RPG lovers. For people never play RPG game, I\&#39;m sure you still get many fun from it.&#39;

b&#34;In this tense and character-driven romantic tragi-comedy, we are given an insight into the intertwining lives of four thirtysomething Parisians. At the centre is Vinz Cassell&#39;s portrayal of Max. A starry-eyed Romeo, he falls head over heels for beautiful stranger Lisa (Bellucci). Encouraged by his put-upon best friend Lucien (\xc3\x89coffey, in an understated but effective performance), he wins her heart and they live happily ever after... that is, until the scheming, neurotic and obsessive Alice (the versatile Romane Bohringer) becomes very involved in the lives and loves of the other three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rich plot is thickened by a curious chronological jumble, and the movie emerges as an intricate jigsaw, the eye-candy of picture-postcard Paris at the heart of it all. The use of colour does not go unnoticed, particularly in Lisa&#39;s spectacular apartment (presumably accounting for the film&#39;s title), where the reds and yellows provoke the fires of passion and lust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The audience can relate to Max: he truly wears his heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished by irony and circumstance for it. In one memorable scene, our fated lovers (agonisingly separated by a &#39;choreographed&#39; misunderstanding) narrowly miss out on the chance meeting that would surely reunite them. Independent of one another, they travel to the same destination: her on the Metro, him in a taxi, practically t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate. Yet fate seems to have it in for them, and the audience is captivatingly teased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performances in this film are really what make L&#39;Appartement stand out. I still cannot understand why Vincent Cassell is not a big star outside France. He has presence and diversity in abundance. Monica Bellucci (Cassell&#39;s real-life spouse at the time of writing) has recently found fame in the Anglophone film industry, but perhaps for the wrong reasons - true, she is divinely beautiful, but behind that is a talented actress who can dominate a scene in classic &#39;leading-lady&#39; style, which many British and American actresses dismiss in favour of the all-too-easy &#39;subtle&#39; approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, watch this film! I doubt you&#39;ll be disappointed. It is gripping, satisfying, amusing, sad, lavish, and a lesson in artistic film-making.&#34;

b&#34;The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as handyman. She is a war widow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set is limited but the acting makes up for this. Robert Ryan is conflicted: one moment he seems nice, then confused about where he lives. At first Lupino tries to help him. He seems troubled but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know? The suspense builds. I truly enjoy films like this, which rely on the human element for suspense. What is this man capable of?. There are some scenes with O.Z. Whitehead and Dee Pollock as an annoying grocery boy who sees something is wrong. We keep thinking she will be helped, then Ryan&#39;s personality turns again. He becomes like a Jekyll/Hyde character and eventually chases Lupino with a knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth watching for these two superb actors. 9/10.&#34;

b&#39;I highly reccommend this movie. It blurs the line between childhood fantasy and everyday reality in such a seamless fashion that it has to be seen to be believed. The actors and director have such perfect timing that in one scene a name calling fight becomes a sort of dance. I loved the story line, the actors, everything. While I do think there were one or two decidedly cheesy scenes, over-all the movie was impeccably done.&#39;

b&#39;spoiler--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1993, African-American director/actor Mario Van Peebles followed up the tremendously popular urban-action film New Jack City with &#34;Posse&#34;. The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also stars as the main character, Jessie Lee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plot: The film begins at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was embroiled in the Spanish-American war. Apparently a time when the U.S. justice system could send convicts into military service, Jessie Lee finds himself an unwilling enlisted man, serving with an all-black cavalry troop in Cuba. Some of his compatriots include Little J (Stephen Baldwin), fast-talking Weezie (Charles Lane) and the towering-but-simple Obobo (Tiny Lister). They find a hidden chest of gold on a reconnaissance run and decide to keep it. However, the ambitious, bigoted Colonel Graham (Zane) finds out about the gold, and is apparently willing to kill Jessie Lee and company for it. A shootout between the Graham\&#39;s forces and Jessie Lee\&#39;s leaves the colonel blind in one eye, and his forces retreat. Jessie Lee\&#39;s ragtag crew manage to smuggle themselves (and the gold) back to New Orleans, but it turns out that Graham isn\&#39;t far behind. Jessie Lee and his allies are forced to go on the run, heading west, to a town called Freemanville. Apparently, Freemanville was founded by blacks in the years following the Civil War. Jessie Lee\&#39;s father, &#34;King David&#34;, was the charismatic preacher who co-founded the town. However, as is revealed in intermittent flashbacks, King David was soon brutally murdered by a white mob, in a parallel of the Ku Klux Klan terror campaigns that began around the same time. Jessie Lee and company eventually find their way to Freemanville, only to find that the townsfolk aren\&#39;t exactly glad to see him\xc2\x97especially when Sheriff Bates (Richard Jordan) of a nearby white township makes it clear that he wants Jessie Lee and his partners\xc2\x97dead or alive. Carver (Blair Underwood) is the sheriff and de facto mayor of Freemanville\xc2\x97and his own agenda may not square with having Jessie Lee around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Analysis The action sequences are all very credible, and Mario Van Peebles turns in a good performance as the brooding hero. In the aftermath of the success of New Jack City, it was almost expected Van Peebles would helm a sequel, or at least a similar urban-action follow-up. Instead, Van Peebles looked 100 years into the past, creating a mostly-black Western (effectively \&#39;updating\&#39; the black-themed Westerns of the 1970\&#39;s), and continuing the legacy of largely-forgotten black-themed cowboy films from the early 20th century. Unlike New Jack City, the film was independently financed, and originally released through Gramercy/Polygram Entertainment. Allegedly, execs at the major studios balked when Van Peebles pitched \&#39;Posse\&#39; to them. Some of the more &#34;curious&#34; casting at the time involved rappers Big Daddy Kane and Tone Loc as Father Time and Angel, respectively. In certain interviews, Mario Van Peebles has said that he often likes to cast against type; in the years since, the trend of casting rap singers in non-musical films would become almost commonplace. Keen viewers will notice several cameos by various entertainment personalities: Black-action film veterans like Isaac Hayes (&#34;Truck Turner&#34;), Pam Grier (&#34;Foxy Brown&#34;) and Larry Cook (&#34;The Spook who Sat by the Door&#34;) show up, as does stand-up legend Nipsey Russell, not to mention TV producer Stephen J. Cannell (who hired the junior Van Peebles to star in &#34;Sonny Spoon&#34; years earlier). The film is bookended with Woody Strode (&#34;Spartacus&#34;) in a key role.&#39;

b&#34;I watched this film with my family over a long Thanksgiving holiday weekend. I am thankful that someone insisted that we watch it, though I didn&#39;t pay much attention until the end of the film when a head shearing seems promised, but, alas, doesn&#39;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I watched this movie some years later and loved its liveliness, absurdity, sparkle, and just plain fun. I think that the film has a female tone. Women are not exploited in it even though I am sure that someone might think that the movie is pure exploitation. I think the movie plays with tropes of the period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep thinking someone ought to remake it. And flesh out some of the implications in the original.&#34;

b&#34;Hey now, I have never laid eyes on a Manga comic, but apparently this movie is based on one. Ah well, such is life. Anyway, this is a pretty bizarre, to say the least, movie, as things literally spiral out of control in a small Japanese town. People are becoming obsessed with the uzumaki (spiral) and this young girl watches her friend&#39;s father videotape a snail, and later in the movie, people start becoming snails? It also seems this boy&#39;s dad becomes so obsessed he somehow commits suicide in a household appliance. There is some bizarre humor here that might be at home in a Tim Burton movie, but there is some nastiness &amp; gore like only the Japanese can do with justice. As with a lot of Japanese films though, the ending is the ending, and did anything get resolved? Well, not to my mind, it didn&#39;t. There are some hints as to why this is all happening but they aren&#39;t explored and there&#39;s a lot left to either the imagination or else it wasn&#39;t deemed important. Still though, there are lots of things for the eye to feast on and if you aren&#39;t obsessed with everything making perfect sense, this is well worth seeing, because it&#39;s just so original and bizarre. My favorite was the father with the spinning eyeballs, personally. 8 out of 10 stars.&#34;

b&#39;John Travolta was excellent as &#34;Michael&#34; in the movie by the same name. I don\&#39;t think a better portrayal could have been done. The movie was funny, yet touching. Michael is a very &#34;human angel&#34; (If their is such). Andie MacDowell is superb in her role as a reporter, as she goes from disbelief to belief. Bill Hurt and Robert Pastorelli are great as fellow reporters, each bent on proving the hoax of the angel on earth. Each of the supporting cast is wonderful, especially the older woman (I do not know her screen name), who plays Michael\&#39;s mother! One of the cutest movies I have seen in years... I could watch this movie dozens of times!&#39;

b&#34;This bright hilarious English comedy about school girl antics is a neglected gem. The significant question is where is the audience? The film is rated 10 by most voters, but how many voters is that? They don&#39;t make comedies like this anymore because the films don&#39;t get distributed or seen. I would never miss a chance to see this old art house classic again. But where are the art houses?&#34;

b&#39;LIGHTS OF NEW YORK was the first &#34;all-taking&#34; feature film, coming in at a brisk 57 minutes and directed by Bryan Foy (of the famous vaudeville family).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story has two dopey barbers (Cullen Landis, Eugene Palette) yearning for a chance at &#34;big city life&#34; and getting involved with gangsters and bootleg booze. One of the guys gets framed for the murder of a cop but is saved at the last minute by a gun moll (Gladys Brockwell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much of the story takes place in a night club called The Night Hawk, which is run by a crook named Hawk (Wheeler Oakman) who has his eye on a pretty chorine (Helene Costello) who is the girl friend of Landis. Costello gets to do a brief dance, and we hear Harry Downing (made up to resemble Ted Lewis) sing &#34;At Dawning) in his best Al Jolson style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting ranges from good (Palette and Brockwell) to awful (Oakman). A couple of the actors muff their lines but then keep right on with the scene. As noted elsewhere this was intended to be a short 2-reeler and was made on a shoestring budget. Yet the sound quality is surprisingly good, the voices all register clearly, and there is a neat cinematic touch in the silhouette death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film was a box-office smash even though it was shown as a silent film where theaters were not wired for the new sound technology. No one expected this little film to gross an amazing $1.3 million. It briefly made stars of Costello and Landis and certainly launched Palette on his long career as a star character actor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Co-stars include Mary Carr as the mother, Robert Elliott as the detective, Eddie Kane as the street cop, and Tom Dugan as a thug.&#39;

b&#39;A &#34;sleeper&#34;. I had never even heard of this movie until I was channel jumping one night. I\&#39;ve been a police officer myself for 25 years and thought this was a true to life movie. Non-police critics are rating the movie purely from a critic\&#39;s point of view and not from a police officer\&#39;s point of view. This is real.&#39;

b&#34;This is a wonderful film taking place during the romantic period of the Civil War. This film is a must see for Eastwood Fans and Eastwood claims this is one of his most favorite films that he did. I couldn&#39;t agree more. Watch out! This is a spoiler- Eastwood does die in the end. Eastwood and director Don Siegel rightfully argued that the ending should be unexpected and should be unhappy for a few reasons. They wanted to stick to the book, for one. Secondly, there can&#39;t always be a happy ending. Thirdly, this was written during the Vietnam War- they wanted a negative statement to this terrible struggle of war where people were needlessly dying. I agree with all of this. It is a wonderfully shot film and I love most films involving the Civil War. It is more of a portrait of how deceptive women can be- that they can be more dangerous than men, hence the title has much to do with the statement of the film BEGUILED- to be deceived. The song sung by Eastwood at the beginning and the end of the film is another statement against not just the Civil War but the Vietnam War and maybe indirectly the women he comes across during the film. Wonderful story of love and deception and many memorable scenes- NOTE: This film is rated R for no reason. There is hardly any language, it is probably some of the subject matter involving sex- but there is no nudity really. Excellent film- 9/10.&#34;

b&#34;I think I was recommended this film by the lady in the shop I was hiring it from! For once she was bang on! What a superb film! First of all I was convinced James McAvoy &amp; Romola Garai were Irish so convincing were their accents; and by half way through the film I was utterly convinced Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and pretty sure James McAvoy was also! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their &#39;normal&#39; guise, to say I was blown away would be an understatement!!! I can remember all the acclaim Dustin Hoffmann got back in the 80&#39;s for his portrayal of autism in the film &#39;Rain Man&#39; - quite frankly (in my opinion of course!)Steven Robertson&#39;s performance/portrayal blows Dustin Hoffmann&#39;s right out of the water - and he deserves recognition as such!! All in all one of the greatest portrayals of human friendship/love/relationships ever - and it was made in Britain/Ireland with home grown actors - stick that in yer pipe and smoke it Hollywood!&#34;

b&#34;A criminally short lived show that went on to spawn three movie spin-offs (Naked Gun 1, 2 &amp; 3), this is fast-paced, in your face, rapid fire comedy that has more hits than misses. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leslie Nielsen plays Detective Lieutenant Sergeant Frank Drebin, an incompetent Detective who bumbles and fumbles his way through cases, with the capable assistant of his boss, Capt. Ed Hocken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story lines are spurious, at best, but it&#39;s deliberate, as the goodness here lies not in the storytelling, but in the weaving of a constant flurry of jokes along with some genuinely weird and wonderful characters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jokes themselves come in many forms, be it wordplay, slapstick, puns or background gags, most of them hitting the spot, though some fall a little flat. It&#39;s inevitable with this &#39;gag every few seconds&#39; approach that some will fail, but the ratio is good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The characters are a delight. From the guest star of the week dying in the opening seconds of every episode, the laboratory scientist who appears to be conducting cruel and unusual experiments on children to the shoe-shine who is some form of oracle, the writing is witty and sharp as a cutlass. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though not especially successful at the time, it rapidly developed a cult following, many blaming the shows&#39; relative lack of success on being way ahead of its time and too sophisticated for the target audience, chief amongst them none other than Matt &#39;The Simpsons&#39; Groening: and he should know. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dated by todays standards, if you can see through that aspect, you&#39;re in for a treat.&#34;

b&#39;I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I had no idea what it was called, so, I went to the I Need To Know section on IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. Anyway, eventually someone on IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie. So eventually i got a hold of it on DVD, and I now keep this movie as one of my most valuable horror movies. I really love it, and I think anyone who watches it, will be very scared in the woods the next time they go. 9/10.&#39;

b&#39;I think this movie has got it all. It has really cool music that I can never get out of my head. It has cool looking characters. IS REALLY funny(you know, the kind that you\&#39;ll crack up on the ground and you\&#39;ll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks).Despite the bad acting, bad cgi, and bad story(about cops going after a robot), its really cool. Its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch, get together, eat pizza, laugh like crazy, and watch it two more times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many funny parts, like when Kurt was trying to get Edison\&#39;s attention and gave him the finger, and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball. On that part, I kept saying &#34;Remember, Remember?&#34;to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened. There was also a really funny part when Edision ran into the room and Kurt was there(just before they fought) and Kurt was talking about his &#34;Strange dream&#34; and how he was &#34;Superman&#34;. I LOVED that part, although it has been a while since I saw it, so I don\&#39;t remember that part. Everything the actors said were funny, like how Kurt says, &#34;I worship you, like a GOD!&#34; to the robot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there was some bad things, in all it was a GREAT movie. Man, I can\&#39;t stop laughing. I wish I had that movie. );&#39;

b&#39;I enjoyed the movie very much. Everything in The Italian Job is simple. An explosive guy, a safe-cracker, a computer genius, a wheel-man and a man with a spectacular plan of stealing 35 million without using a gun. This film is entertaining although it has no central idea. It is a non-stop movie with lots of actions. All the stunt work is gorgeous. From the speedboat chase in Venice at the beginning to the chase on the busy roads in Los Angeles involving three mini coopers and even a helicopter. The best boast chase I have ever seen. I like the mini coopers. The expert thieves used mini coopers for the getaway cars. The chase between the mini coopers and the motor-bikes is amazing. They chased underground. I can say there was not a moment I was bored. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Croker), Charlize Theron (Stella Bridger), Donald Sutherland (John Bridger), Jason Statham (Handsome Rob), Seth Green (Lyle), Mos Def (Left Ear) and Edwin Norton (Steve) really did a good job. I like the actors in this film. I have seen a lot of heist movie but The Italian Job&amp; is one of my favourites. A great Hollywood action movie without a drop of blood. After all, I do love this kind of movie.&#39;

b&#39;SPOILERS Every major regime uses the country\&#39;s media to it\&#39;s own ends. Whether the Nazi banning of certain leaflets, or the televised Chinese alternative of Tianamen Square, Governments have tried to influence the people through different mediums since the beginning of time. In 1925 though, celebrating the failed mutiny of 1905, the Russian Communist Government supported the creation of this film, Battleship Potempkin. A major piece of cinematic history, it remains powerful and beautiful to this very day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set aboard the Battleship Potempkin, the crew are unhappy. In miserable living conditions and with maggot infested food, they are angry at their upper class suppressors. Now though, after the rotten food, enough is enough. Led by Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), the crew turn upon their masters and fight for their freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as propaganda goes, &#34;Battleship Potempkin&#34; is perfect. Presenting a positive light on the first, unsuccessful, communist mutiny, the film was a useful Soviet tool. Eighty years after the films release though, and the USSR has disappeared completely off the map. The amazing thing about this film though is that whilst the country it\&#39;s message was intended for has disappeared, the film remains a powerful and worthy piece of cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written and directed by Sergei Eisenstein, the film is surprisingly a joy to watch. It is true, that it is far from what we would nowadays consider \&#39;entertainment\&#39;, but the film is a beautiful piece of art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether it be the scenes aboard the boat or the often talked about scene on the steps of Odessa, everything about this film is perfectly made. The music is powerful and dramatic, the lighting is flawless, even the acting, whilst slightly overdone, is perfect for the piece. Basically, there is no way to fault this film\&#39;s end product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s impossible to know how the Russian people received this film upon it\&#39;s release. Praising a country which has not existed for fifteen years, it\&#39;s difficult for us to know the full spirits that the film inspires. As a piece of art though, it is magnificent. Beautiful from start to finish, it is far from an easy watch, but it is well worth the effort.&#39;

b&#34;I was fortunate to see a screening of this remarkable short film by Joshua Leonard before its premiere at the 2005 Sundance Festival. In twelve brief but exquisite minutes, Leonard takes us on a life-changing journey as he probes one of the most controversial contemporary social and ethical issues facing our society. The film embodies elegant direction, moving performances and a heart- rending story. Kelli Garner and Lucas Haas radiate as the two lovers. And, in his first venture into dramatic narrative, Leonard proves to be a director with a propitious future. I feel this short should be expanded into a feature film. It&#39;s difficult to describe talent, but as this debut film demonstrates, you know it when you see it!&#34;

b&#39;I thought that this was the most interesting film that JCVD has done in a very long time. I loved his character and the whole thing with the rabbit set a different tone for this film. IMHO, JCDV may really be on to something going forward. A little more light heartedness, some obvious homages to other films, mixed in with some great fights...I would like to see more this style of film-making from him. One of the other posters thought that the bar scene was a Desperado rip off. I immediately saw the R. Rodriguez connection also, but thought it was very clever and made me want to see the film again to look for more subtle cues from other films. JCVD rocks!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other stuff after reading other comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No music in the dungeon fight? At first I didn\&#39;t like that at first either, but then I thought it was interesting because it threw me off balance a bit by giving us something that we didn\&#39;t expect. Made it seem more real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also always get a laugh when directors cry like 2 year olds that their film was &#34;stolen&#34; from the studio. Directors are paid to do a job. The studio is the boss and they want the product that they want. Very few directors have absolute final cut on a film. In this case, JCVD is THE talent and the only reason anyone is watching this film. I am sure he got a film that he was happy with. I have a relative who works at a post house who knew a little of the story. PRESUMABLY, the director worked on and delivered his cut of the film. Everyone who saw it said it was a disaster...then JCVD and the studio re edited the movie. This stuff happens all the time. He also did see the final cut (which he claims he didn\&#39;t) and his &#34;delicate genius&#34; ego was severely bruised because they hated his delivered cut. If this director was smart, he should have taken credit for this one as it would have been his best.&#39;

b&#34;i originally seen the flash Gordon serial on PBS,and thought it was fun and awesome,i overlooked the special effects of the rocket ships with sparklers,and the big dragon monster with lobster claws,who cares this is 1936 and it was a serial,so each week they would show a new chapter, buster Crabbe played flash Gordon 3 times,in all 3 serials.then in 1939 he played buck rogers,in 1933 he played Tarzan the fearless.he was a very busy actor.beautiful jean rogers played sexy dale Arden.frank Shannon as professor zarkov,and Charles Middleton played the evil ming the merciless.he makes Darth Vader look like a boyscout.the serials were very close to the Alex Raymond comic strip.space travel was just a pipe dream at the time.not to mention ray guns and television.this one stands out as the best serial ever.the sequel flash Gordon&#39;s trip to mars is 2 chapters longer,the next flash Gordon conquers the universe is only 12 chapters.and then there&#39;s the natives of mongo..,hawk-men, lion-men,shark-men.the feature version leaves out the shark-men scenes. for the full effect you must see the complete serial.i heard George Lucas was inspired by flash Gordon when he did star wars.flash Gordon was from universal studios.and the music on the soundtrack is from many universal movies like bride of Frankenstein,werewolf of London,Dracula&#39;s daughter,etc;even today flash Gordon continues to delight people young and old.10 out of 10.&#34;

b&#34;The Beloved Rogue is a wonderful period piece. It portrays 145th century Paris in grand Hollywood fashion, yet offering a bleaker side to existence there as it would be experienced by the poor. And the snow. It&#39;s constantly swirling about, adding to the severity of the setting -- brilliant! The setting is enhanced by the odd cast of characters, including beggars, cripples and dwarfs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A brilliant performance is turned in by John Barrymore, outdone only by the magnificent Conrad Veidt, who portrays a degenerate, dissolute Louis XI to perfection. And yes, Veidt picks his nose on purpose, pushing his portrayal to wonderfully wry limits.&#34;

b&#39;I resisted watching 15 Park Avenue despite of recommendations, discarding the movie as a clich\xc3\xa9d topic of extreme emotional dramas and over-the-top acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in a while, movies like 15 Park Avenue come by and sweep you off your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie grasps your attention pretty early on and there is no moment to rest after that. Aparna Sen has done a wonderful job of gluing the audience to every line of the movie. The impeccable character development, &#34;just right&#34; amount of emotions and an enigmatic end to match it all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a renewed respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who convincingly plays the schizophrenic Mithi. She beats expectation yet again after Page-3 and Mr.&amp; Mrs.Iyer. Prof. Anjali\&#39;s role is very well developed and Shabana does full justice to the character. Rahul Bose, Shefali Chaya, Waheeda Rehman add incredible flavor to the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I define &#34;shower moments&#34; as thoughts of scenes from a movie that you ponder over in your shower endlessly, till your wife/girlfriend/mom bangs at the door. 15PA delivers many &#34;shower moments&#34; especially the conversation between Anjali and her mother where the mother is cautious when talking to Anjali about her thoughts. It immediately brings out Anjali\&#39;s personality to the audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end is a very bold statement by the director; probably too westernized for the Indian audience; yet delivers the elements to promote the movie from a &#34;good&#34; to a &#34;great&#34; status.&#39;

b&#39;Dead or Alive: Final, the movie that supposedly brings together the three films in the very loose Dead or Alive trilogy, and connected mostly by its stars, Riki Takeiuchi and Sho Aikawa and that each film has its share of bizarro-world fixtures and neuroses and heaps of violence, is admittedly the weakest of the lot. That none of the three films ends up being a disappointment is less a testament to the creativity of the material but to the pound-for-pound guts that director Takashi Miike takes with the surroundings and the material. Here he presents an overtly dystopian future, however low-key, where a homosexual mayor/dictator (Richard Chen) has the entire village drugged except for a group of rebels. There\&#39;s also replicants- robots- in this year of 2346, one of them is Ryo (Aikawa), a robot of complete lethal skill but also with the capacity to love and learn and so forth. Then a cop, Takeshi (Takeiuchi) happens to be the mayor\&#39;s top guard. But things start to unravel on both sides, Ryo teaming up with the rebels and Takeshi with his employer, though blood-soaked mishaps like a hostage trade-off gone bad, and with Takeshi finding out his wife and son are robots (not done in an Alien mood, mind you, just suddenly as if in a the power went out), and that he himself is one as well. And it all leads up to one last, inexplicable showdown between the two men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strange that there\&#39;s yet another film where Miike has peaks and valleys here, sometimes finding that middle ground of success where science fiction can have some meaning to it. But there really isn\&#39;t anything to take from this story, except that the mayor/dictator is a dingbat with no back-story who gets his rocks off making sure his drug stops couples from getting pregnant and that everything remains under control. He also has along with him his love slave, I\&#39;d guess, in the hilarious non-speaking part of a saxophone player who also doubles sometimes as a human fixture when not plugging away the moody blues. Meanwhile, we get the conventional sides to Ryo and Takeshi\&#39;s stories, and they\&#39;re never uninteresting, just not totally convincing enough to hold interest. Of course Miike isn\&#39;t above having some fun, like when Takeshi plops Michelle (Maria Chen) in to the water to get her to swim after a near-assassination attempt on the mayor, or in having the original rebel leader speaking English for no good reason at all. There\&#39;s even a playful homage to old sci-fi cartoons at the start of the film. But there\&#39;s nothing very compelling substance-wise, with the exception of Takeshi\&#39;s minor turns at becoming &#34;good&#34; midway through the film (helping one couple get by with clearance to have a kid), and mostly Miike\&#39;s strengths this time are purely stylistically and in the choice of locations and sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s like a grungy Japanese Alphaville where everything still has a contemporary feel through all of the special effects. And I really liked the yellow-green tint Miike used through the movie, as it impacted very well in outdoor scenes and added just enough grittiness in the indoor scenes. But as for peaks and valleys, one sees this ever more clearly- and the sci-fi movie channel level of visual effects, with maybe a few more dollars put into it- during the climax. This contains some of the funniest material in the most delirious, Freudian sensibility from the director, even if it has to get started by unbearable contrivance; the way that Ryo and Takeshi finally meet up is sort of random and just a means for the producers to try and cheaply tie together the past two films, when it wasn\&#39;t needed. On the other hand, in terms of the sheer guilty entertainment value of a flick like Miike\&#39;s where one sees something totally unexpected and very crudely sexual, it ranks right up there with the best scenes in Happiness of the Katakuris and Visitor Q. Overall, Dead or Alive: Final is a cheesy 90 minute effort that doesn\&#39;t take itself TOO seriously, and is better off all the more for its wicked contrivances, militaristic decay and cultural hang-ups put on pulp-level display.&#39;

b&#39;This has been one of the best vampire movies that I have seen in a long time. It was very seductive and alluring, I liked that it did not have the usual gore and carnage that comes along with most vampire movies. The music was excellent. It would be great if there was a sequel.&#39;

b&#34;The Beguiled was one of the few early Eastwood films I hadn&#39;t seen until I gave the DVD a spin today. And from it&#39;s opening sepia-tinged shot to the macabre climax I was utterly enthralled. Too many film-makers these days substitute special effects, fast editing and dizzying camera-work in place of character-driven stories, but Director Don Siegel knew how to get the maximum effect from this relatively simple plot, and the characters are believable and compelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story concerns a ladies finishing school which happens to be situated on the edge of various skirmishes during the American Civil War. The south-supporting ladies find a badly wounded Union soldier (Clint Eastwood); nursing him back to health he begins to manipulate the sexually frustrated women for his own ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geraldine Page is excellent in the role of the headmistress with a secret, and her descent into madness is subtly conveyed. For a film that virtually takes place in a single location it never loses visual interest. There&#39;s even a chance that the normal status quo, long abandoned when Eastwood&#39;s machinations are uncovered, could return; but the mistresses and pupils descend upon a darker road...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a totally different style of film from the same Director&#39;s Dirty Harry, made in the same year, and yet they are both equally superb. Eastwood is great playing against his usual stoic anti-hero image, yet there&#39;s also some mysterious quality attached to his character. We never really learn much about him prior to his incarceration, and the viewer is free to decide upon his well-shaded persona. Villain or Victim? Whatever you think, all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed it.&#34;

b&#39;As a dedicated lover of all things Egyptian this is a classic piece from the 50\&#39;s, along with my other favourite, Land of the Pharaohs&#34;. The sets and colours are just wonderful and everything seems so &#34;neat&#34; in the production quality. I thought Victor Mature was well cast and Peter Ustinov a real gem! The whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) has an appeal that you just don\&#39;t get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I have yet to see the 1999 movie &#34;The Mummy but am sure I will love it!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top stuff!&#39;

b&#34;Film certainly can be a narrative medium, but by no means is it the ideal medium. Literature best carries a plot, because the reader can supply the imagination necessary to complete the structure. Film is appreciated best when viewed for what it is: a series of images grouped together. What Soderbergh does in Ocean&#39;s Twelve is combine impeccable film-making technique with the free-flowing form of American movies from the 1970s. From looking at the comments posted recently, most people went in expecting a standard-issue heist movie, a la Entrapment; it seems people actually miss the tiresome clich\xc3\xa9s of romance disguised as tension between the leads and ridiculous plot twists designed to keep the audience awake. Soderbergh&#39;s directing prowess is reason alone to see this movie, but close-ups of Pitt and Zeta-Jones forty feet high on the screen don&#39;t hurt either. A true treat for those who love the flickering of lights on the silver screen, and a disappointment for those trying to make film something it&#39;s not.&#34;

b&#39;This movie was release when I was 15 and I could easily relate to the themes the film portrayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was over 24 years ago and I haven\&#39;t seen the movie since. This time around I cringed at some of the acting but still appreciate the film for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life is not always fair and the good guys don\&#39;t always win in fact I think the movie did well to reflect that especially as a teenager the pricks always did better with a lot of girls. Also it doesn\&#39;t matter how nice you are you cannot make someone like you. Girls/boys like who they want to like no matter how hard you try otherwise. Sometimes you just gotta let go and say next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary does a good job showing the intensity of his feelings for Karen. This is so true of teenagers when they get fixated on someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember sitting around with mates laughing our arses off at some of the antics. The acting is not quite there compared with Fast Times at Ridgemount High but it kicks ass over this movie simply because FTARH has a lame viewer friendly ending where as this movie has a realistic ending. Nice guys finish last!! Gary comes across as pretty lame cringe worthy material but we all know guys like this who are far to sensitive. We all know a David, fun guy who makes you laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people on here bag the ending but hello the ending is exactly what can happen in real life. Some chicks just go back for more no matter how bad the dude treats them, especially at that age. I have experienced that first hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great sound track too!! U2 &#34;I will follow&#34; - Jesus is it that old??&#39;

b&#39;&#34;Strike Force&#34; or &#34;The Librarians&#34; is a fun action movie that doesn\&#39;t it take itself too seriously. William Forsythe stars as Simon, who is looking for a missing daughter of a wealthy client. He meets up with Sandi (Erika Eleniak) who is also looking for someone-her sister. But there are evil bad guys afoot. The most evil of them all is Marcos Canarious (Andrew Divoff). Marcos likes to kill people. So now, Simon and Sandi have to team up to bring down the villains. The whole cast is great, with Divoff stealing the movie. There are also cameos by Ed Lauter and Burt Reynolds. If you are looking for a good action film, watch this and have a good time.&#39;

b&#39;The Violent Men is pretty good western that certainly benefits from its excellent cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edward G. Robinson is the big rancher trying to squeeze out the smaller ranchers one of whom is Glenn Ford. Ford is ready to sell to appease his fiance (May Wynn) until Robinson\&#39;s ambitious brother (Brian Keith) murders one of Ford\&#39;s hands. Then you know what happens next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Stanwyck is along as Robinson\&#39;s scheming wife the kind of role in which she specialized. Dianne Foster plays their daughter who comes to admire Ford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Violent Men is nothing more than a &#34;B&#34; plot with an &#34;A&#34; movie cast but it is very well done.&#39;

b&#39;A wonderfully thoughtful and involving movie that leaves an imprint well beyond it\&#39;s initial liftoff. Based on a true story , one of the many &#34;small&#34; stories prior to WW II , that lend an understanding to the mindsets of the majority of common man cultures, impacted by others perceived as former enemies and perhaps future foes, with the darkening of war clouds on the horizon. Viewed at the Stony Brook Film festival, the film was enthusiastically received . Well written and expertly cast. The characters were most believable and drew one in to experience their trials and tribulations.&#39;

b&#39;This is an excellent film. No, it\&#39;s not Mel Gibson in &#34;Braveheart,&#34; but then, it\&#39;s not trying to be. Actually, &#34;The Emperor and the Assassin&#34; probably has (thankfully) more in common with a Shakespearean production than a Hollywood blockbuster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the third century BC, the King of Qin is attempting to unite (in other words &#34;conquer&#34;) the seven kingdoms of China. He has already overthrown the Kingdom of Han. Now he needs an excuse to invade the Kingdom of Yan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where the Lady Zhao comes in. She and the King have been friends since childhood. They are obviously very much in love, but cannot marry for political reasons. Together they devise a plot. She will pretend to have fallen into disfavor with the King and escape to Yan. Once there she will convince the Prince of Yan to send an assassin back to kill the King. When the assassination fails, the King will have his excuse to invade Yan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in Yan, however, Lady Zhao begins to reconsider. Hearing and seeing more and more examples of her old childhood friend\&#39;s ruthlessness, she begins to wonder if the King may need to be assassinated for real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One sure sign that you\&#39;re not watching a Hollywood production is the final encounter between the King and the assassin. Unlike a Hollywood movie where the hero and villain are clearly defined and the final outcome already predetermined, this is a fight that could truly go either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a well crafted and well acted story of a tumultuous time in Chinese history. There is a mixture of both incredible beauty and incredible ugliness. Most beautiful of all, however, is Gong Li as the Lady Zhao. I grow more and more convinced every time I see her that Gong Li is the most beautiful woman in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, however, that she does have one unintentionally funny line in this film. Early on Gong Li asks one of her servants &#34;Do I have a beautiful face?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duh!!!&#39;

b&#34;When I was growing up, Voyage into Space was my most favorite movie. I remember the time when KTLA (Channel 5) ran the movie for the whole week and me and my sisters watched it every single day! I still remember every part of that movie. The ending was so sad when Giant Robot got blown up along with Guillotine and then watching Johnny Sokko with all the tears running down his face calling for Giant Robot. There should have been a sequel to the movie, in which Giant Robot somehow survived the explosion. :) I can&#39;t believe that there are so many other Voyage into Space fans still out there. I really want to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD, but my sister said that the ones out there now are bootlegged and probably bad quality copies of the movie. I don&#39;t know why they haven&#39;t released it yet, since it&#39;s been over 40 years now. I think Voyage into Space was made back in 1968. Only now, my second favorite Japanese monster movie of all time (The War of the Gargantuas) is finally coming to DVD and being released on Sept. 9th and I can&#39;t wait! :) Now if only they would do the same with Voyage into Space. Giant Robot, Johnny Sokko, and Voyage into Space will never be forgotten! In my eyes and probably many others too, it will always be a childhood classic to me! :)&#34;

b&#34;This movie started out confusing and grew into one of the best movies I have seen... The acting was utterly superb and when I wasn&#39;t drying my tears I enjoyed Meryl Streep, who&#39;s performance was extraordinary. The movie deals with the hardships of a distant family coping with a mother who develops terminal cancer. The movie was very difficult to watch and heartbreaking. The soundtrack fits this movie to a tee. Brava Bette Midler!! Out of 5 stars, I give this one 4 1/2.&#34;

b&#34;...the opportunity it gave me to look at Ireland&#39;s past was invaluable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the benefit of seeing this with my Mother who hailed from Cork, and in watching, we talked and I learned a lot from her about how things were back then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stuff like how Deasy and Co. was a Cork soft drinks company; how rain truly could destroy a harvest; how farmers used to have to collect the crop; how in dance halls the women and men did really have to stand along opposite walls before the men walked forward and asked the woman to dance; about the bellows that kept the fire going; how priests really did call out the list of church donators and their donations and a bit about the currency back then (which my Dad helped by showing me a case displaying the pence, shillings and crowns that were used back then (which were legal tender in England also)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#39;t pay that much attention to how good the movie was, but I was very grateful in having this opportunity to look back on a period of time that for some is Irish History, but for others including some of our parents and grandparents, is just their childhood.&#34;

b&#34;In the changing world of CG and what-not of cartoon animations etc. etc., Faeries was a warm welcome at least by me. I think it&#39;s important to show these sort of films once in a while, to preserve them and help remind us of where the originality and fun of cartoons actually came from. People were talking about how it is boring because of the graphics and stuff but hey! think about the films that will be considered boring if every film looked like the new state of the art ones everybody and their mother is making these days. Call me old-fashioned but I liked it. It&#39;s a wonderful story about supernatural beings and human beings and all it really needs from its audience is their imagination.&#34;

b&#39;I\&#39;m not much for &#34;cop&#34; movies, but this one is supposedly a classic &amp; when I found it cheap I bought it and stuck it on a shelf, only to finally get around to watching it yesterday, and I LIKED it! Now, you can have New York City, but as a setting for a film like this, in the winter months, it\&#39;s perfect. Roy Scheider is a member of an elite police task group called The Seven Ups, which are 5 guys that fight crime undercover. In an opening scene they recover a shoebox full of money from an antique store by distracting the crooks with a &#34;bull in a china shop&#34; routine. But that\&#39;s only the beginning. Seems that there are two guys, posing as cops, that are kidnapping mob types and holding them for ransom. Richard Lynch happens to be one of these sleaze-bags, and he\&#39;s as creepy as ever. When one of the Seven Ups, who is posing as a limo driver at a funeral, gets his cover blown, he\&#39;s beaten and stuffed into the trunk of a car, which then leads to perhaps one of the most exciting car chases I\&#39;ve seen. Amazing though, how light traffic in NYC is for chase scenes, but still this is rather amazing as Scheider follows the two kidnappers through what I\&#39;m guessing is the Bronx and then onto a turnpike and then eventually, Scheider\&#39;s car comes to a screeching halt in one of the most heart-stopping finales to a chase scene that I\&#39;ve ever witnessed. Anyway, since the cop ends up dying, Scheider and his men are under suspicion because the police commissioner knows so little about their activities he wonders if THEY\&#39;RE on the make by kidnapping mobsters, so of course this kind of thinking needs to be nipped in the bud &amp; Scheider is relentless getting to the bottom of things. Overall a decent cop action/drama, not really my thing but I liked this one. Look for Joe Spinell (Maniac) in a small role. 7 out of 10.&#39;

b&#39;Bridget Fonda has disappointed me several times over the years, but she had my attention in BREAK UP. It\&#39;s true the story is missing critical details in several places, but I just kept scrutinizing Fonda for clues about what was meaningful in the story and she didn\&#39;t let me down. The look in her eyes in the last scene, as she musters up courage to, literally, put one foot in front of the other toward her uncertain future is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of face acting ever. I believed her completely, possibly because I\&#39;ve known and admired several &#34;tough broads&#34; who survived similar abusive situations. And they did this without becoming man-haters, but that\&#39;s my own hopeful projection of Fonda\&#39;s character at the BREAK UP.&#39;

b&#39;Once again Almen\xc3\xa1bar has provided us with a top quality film. This director is amazing, and he\&#39;s proven that he\&#39;s equally talented and effective when crossing genres. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The excellent character development of the movie, through dialogue and personality quirks, but with more subtle details as well (Ramon\&#39;s father\&#39;s gaze), allows the audience to identify with the protagonists very closely, making the importance and emotional impact of the events which take place all the more profound. The visuals are at times, simple, at times stunning (the dream to the beach), and I think Almen\xc3\xa1bar\&#39;s films really benefit from the fact that he also composes the music - it matched the film\&#39;s varying moods flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than just a film about euthanasia, which in itself is an important issue, this film tackles the duality of a man who at times genuinely seems to enjoy life (albeit in a quite limited way), and yet one who is unswerving in his desire to die. The overwhelming sadness of the film is punctuated by well-timed quips of humor, which seem all the funnier because they provide a welcome respite from the melancholy you will certainly feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although clearly in favor of euthanasia, this film does an excellent job representing the myriad points of view of Ramon\&#39;s friends and family. Most poignant was Ramon\&#39;s father, when he said, despondent, &#34;There\&#39;s only one thing worse than losing a child. That the child wants to die.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent writing, acting, directing, cinematography, music - 10/10.&#39;

HOUSE OF WAX SURE DELIVERS!!! In parts it was sort of far-fetched,the acting was not that great,but my overhaul rating for HOUSE OF WAX is an eight out of ten......if you enjoy being at the edge of your seats, this is just the right movie for you,I have to admit,it was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax...... I myself enjoy these museums, but after seeing this film I will now look at them in a whole new different way!&#39;

b&#34;Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) engage in a battle of wits for control of a Switz inventor&#39;s newest bomb-sight creation. Holmes wants to safeguard it for the British while Moriarty isn&#39;t above selling out to the Nazis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While no doubt many fans will be disappointed to see Holmes updated to the 1940s war-time setting, this particular film proves light-hearted fun which doesn&#39;t wallow in wartime propaganda as it might well have done. Dennis Hoey&#39;s Inspector Lestrade and Nigel Bruce&#39;s Dr. Watson do tend to steal the show as their characters bumbling methods consistently provide delightful comic relief. The sparring between Holmes and Moriraty is colorful and well thought out to boot. Atwill does well enough as Moriarty even if he&#39;s not as memorable as some others who played the role. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this provides nothing especially new or thrilling for fans of the series, it is a wonderful escape from reality, somewhat appropriate for 1942 in my opinion, that mirrors many movie serial adventures of the 1930s and 1940s but boasts a more compact, less repetitive plot. And all this is done while still remaining true to the basic spirit of Sherlock Holmes.&#34;

b&#39;Uzak (2002), a Turkish film shown in the U.S. as &#34;Distant,&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was directed, produced, written, and filmed by Nuri Bilge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ceylan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is a gritty and somber version of the clash between a &#34;city mouse,&#34; Mahmut, played by Muzaffer \xc3\x96zdemir, and a &#34;country mouse,&#34; Yusuf, played by Emin Toprak. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both men are superb actors, and the plot allows them to demonstrate their acting skill. (Tragically, Emin Toprak died in an automobile accident shortly after the movie was completed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In most country cousin/city cousin tales, the contrast between rural and urban life styles is portrayed in a humorous fashion. In this film, there\&#39;s little humor or even warmth. Both men&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have lost touch with human society. Mahmut \&#39;s work as a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;commercial photographer for a tile company gives him no satisfaction. He has divorced a woman he clearly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;still loves, and has no satisfying human relationships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mahmut has lost his job because of a factory closing in his small town, and doesn\&#39;t have the skills or the energy to find work in the city. His human interactions are primarily confined to silent observations of the other people who cross his path. He\&#39;s clearly a warm and caring person, but can\&#39;t express these qualities in an urban environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cousins don\&#39;t relate well to the world, and they don\&#39;t relate well to each other. Neither makes an effort to act in a way that would provide an opportunity for bonding or closeness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a sense, this film portrays an opportunity wasted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conceivably, each cousin could have provided at least part of what was lacking in the other\&#39;s life. Instead, they steer parallel unhappy courses. The two men are distant throughout, which is a situation suggested by the film\&#39;s title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my friends mentioned the masterful way in which Ceylan builds detail upon detail. These details ultimately tell us more about the characters than we might have learned by simple exposition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uzak was shown as part of the Rochester Labor Film series. It\&#39;s not a &#34;labor film&#34; in the traditional sense of that genre. It is a labor film because it demonstrates the harmful effects of unsatisfying work (Mahmut) and unemployment (Yusuf).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a quiet, absorbing, dark film. Although it doesn\&#39;t make for happy viewing, I walked out of the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;theater realizing that I had seen a truly creative and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;important movie. This film is worth finding and seeing!&#39;

b&#34;1959 was a landmark in the world of film. Several great directors of the classic era were releasing career capping classics that ranked among their best. Just a look at the titles is instructive, Hitchcock&#39;s North By Northwest, Billy Wilder&#39;s Some Like It Hot, Howard Hawks&#39; Rio Bravo, Douglas Sirk&#39;s Imitation of Life. Add a couple from the previous year, Orson Welles&#39; Touch of Evil, Hitch&#39;s Vertigo, and Nick Ray&#39;s Wind Across the Everglades, and you&#39;ve got a pretty good summing up of what was possible within the classic Hollywood style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, two films appeared that hinted at a whole new way of making films. One was Jean-Luc Godard&#39;s Breathless, the other was John Cassavetes Shadows. The two films had certain things in common, largely improvised acting by non stars, handheld cameras, low budgets, and a certain youthful, jazzy swagger. In certain ways, though, they couldn&#39;t be farther apart. Godard was still a believer in the director as arbiter of style. He knew more about film than most Hollywood producers, and Breathless was filled with the iconography of the classic crime film. Cassavetes, on the other hand, was an actor, and a refugee from New York&#39;s underground theater scene. His first film shows him little impressed with the cinema, and a big believer in actors. Godard&#39;s film constantly references it&#39;s own artifice, whereas Shadows aims for a certain kind of naturalism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#39;t reach it, mainly because naturalism is a myth, particularly in cinema. But it feels powerful, kinetic but lilting like the cool jazz on the score, certainly the main inspiration for the filmmaking style on display here. It ultimately doesn&#39;t hold together, mainly because Cassavetes&#39; actors here are amateurish beatniks, where Cassavetes style requires strong, imaginative actors. His later work with Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazarra, and Peter Falk blows this out of the water. Due to the director&#39;s technical inexperience, some bits of dialogue had to be redubbed later, which defeats the freshness of the improvisation. Still it&#39;s fascinating to watch, both for the great moments (like the scene where Leila Goldoni talks about her dissapointment with losing her virginity) and to watch a groundbreaking artist finding his way.&#34;

b&#39;I\&#39;m surprised that mine, so far, is the only comment on this t.v. movie...as far as I\&#39;m aware, the series itself, has had a huge following, reviewer pundits and real people alike, have praised it to a person. Anyway, let me tell you right away that, if like me, you\&#39;re a sucker for gritty police dramas, you\&#39;ll like &#34;The Lost Child&#34; Tennison, the heroine, throughout the &#34;Prime Suspect&#34;series, has been battling the male police establishment, throughout the series, getting to her present, comparatively powerful rank in the police hierarchy through hard work,obstinacy, and sheer talent for police work. She is,essentially, an ambitious career woman, but she has a romantic side and is certainly no man-hater. Unfortunately her relationships are affected by the wicked hours, which her career demands, and she has never married, so when she finds herself pregnant from her latest affair, she is faced with the choice of becoming a mother, and jeopardising her entire police job, let alone future advancement, or having an abortion - which she opts for. This abortion never looms large in the ensuing drama - it\&#39;s very skilfully dealt with, in less than a couple of minutes screentime, a marvel of economy in scripting, and editing - but it\&#39;s always there, as a counterpoint to Tennison\&#39;s desperate efforts to find another &#34;lost child&#34; - a kidnap victim - before it\&#39;s too late. The story takes many twists and turns,before the surprise ending, and one is fascinated, alike, by the plot, and characters (although I found the many villains a little overdrawn), the police, and especially Tennison, herself, are not always competent, nor that likeable, which figures, given the unpleasant job that they have to do, in the sleazy underworld which this series, habitually inhabits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mirren, herself, has said that she\&#39;ll make no more movies in the series, but, excellent as she\&#39;s always been in the role of Tennison, the series, itself, is as &#34;actor proof&#34; as is another addiction of mine -Dick Wolf\&#39;s American&#34;Law &amp; Order&#34; - whoever appears therein, each could go on forever. As is my fervent hope.&#39;

He doesn&#39;t know how he arrived there, but a welcome sign has been erected for him. After momentarily pondering his whereabouts, he is greeted by a man who takes him to his new life. He then enters a world different to the one he came from. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Andreas is quickly introduced to his new job as an accountant, he senses that his surroundings are a bit too uniformed for his liking. As he takes his first lunch break, he instantly notices that everyone in the city walks around in grey suits. On this same day, he sees a fellow businessman dead on some fencing spikes, of what looks like an act of suicide. The strange thing is, the city folk pay no attention to this horrific act and walk on by as if it never happened. It is quick to see that these people are genetically desensitised, and their ability to distinguish between anything humane or inhumane is absent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help Andreas settle in, he is invited to go out with his co-workers to a local nightclub. The club appears to be one step away from becoming as exciting as a bingo night..and as Andreas drinks his sorrows aways, he realises that no matter how much he drinks, the alcohol has no effect on him. As he tells these observances to a stranger in the men&#39;s room, a man in a toilet cubicle starts to utter words which have been on Andreas&#39; mind all along. Realising that this man is thinking what he is, he follows him to his house, and notes where he lives for future reference. The plot predictably evolves with Andreas wanting an escape. He seeks out the man he once followed...hoping that he could lead him to becoming human again...but is it too late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thoughts: This norwegian film is something which everyone should see, as it holds the answer to the big question! What is the meaning of life? (well, close enough). The film sketches out the dark realities of what has become of today&#39;s working man (or woman). It&#39;s sole purpose is making people realise that life is too short to be materialistic. It tries to show that small clich\xc3\xa9 things, such as the sound of children playing, should not be taken for granted, because the moment you stop hearing that sound, is the moment you&#39;re one step away from becoming a robot. The ending of the film reiterates what happens when its too late to escape the mundane routine you&#39;ve now become used to. You start to adopt the saying of &#39;if it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it&#39;, and become too comfortable to take a risk of change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this film is not to be taken as a piece of realism...its message is more than real. The lack of empathy conveyed in the film, and that of which Andreas sees, is a bold statement of what life can become. The director, Jens Lien has put together a film, which in any other director&#39;s hands would have failed. This is a fine piece of cinematic genius, and i eagerly await to see what he does next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lead role, played by Trond Fausa Aurvaag is perfectly cast. Representing the average Joe, Trond provides a good catalyst in making this picture darkly humorous. The supporting actors also do an apt job, and for some reason, i feel that Keanu Reeves would have been perfect in this film, as most of the supporting cast required their acting to be emotionless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The score for this film was beautifully composed. The recurring theme was always a delight to listen to, and it provided a very sombre but welcomed feel to the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set for a release date in the UK for 25th May 2007, i will definitely be going to re-live this experience on the big screen. This film has gained its way in my top 10...now quickly becoming my top 20! It has some shocking scenes, and is darkly humorous throughout...A MUST -SEE!!&#34;

b&#39;Between sweeping, extraordinary scenes within a plethora of Indian locations and a plot which is Bollywood inspired yet grounded in reality, this highly moving film is a must-see for those who love a good romance/adventure. And by this, I mean &#34;good&#34;, not a Hollywood or Bollywood easy and contrived happy ending. East meets West in a different take on the buddy film. The performances are inspired and brilliant, the cinematography epic and the plot entertaining, engaging and poignant without a trace of schmaltz or cheap tugging at heartstrings. HARI OM is a sweet film that won\&#39;t rot your teeth. See it!&#39;

b&#39;It may not be Oscar material, however this was a very funny film. I was always a fan of Eddie (Edmondson) &amp; Richie (Mayall). &#34;Bottom&#34; &amp; &#34;Young Ones&#34; were legendary TV series\&#39;, and it was about time they made a film. Some of the stuff they get up to is brilliant, from the pencil is the rear-end, to the rubber sex-pants, as well was the infamous line that Richie says when he falls and a candle he is carrying goes into his eye. He says to Eddie &#34;Candle In The Eye, Candle In The Eye&#34;, and Eddie been the simpleton that he is, sticks the candle he\&#39;s carrying into his eye. Can\&#39;t forget when Eddie is on his motorbike, and he needs to urinate.... It was a great comedy, not to be taken seriously at all, but the film lacked with an ridicilous ending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall, a exellent comedy, full of laughs, and lots of fake green vomit. A 9/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;

b&#39;i honestly dont know why so many people hate this movie, i have always thought that it was one of my absolute faves. the fight with tiger and his men rocked, the fight with the pirates with the axes rocked, the whole skit with everyone trying to avoid one another in the house is pure genious...ok so it didnt have the requisite kick ass final confrontation but the manchus were pretty good. i give it a 8/10.&#39;

b&#34;I really enjoyed this movie, and I&#39;m not a classical music fan. The story of the tough street kid discovering classical music and changing his ways was great to watch, without being sentimental or too unbelievable, although some details had me scratching my head (Frankie and his dog can live in the basement of the school without any of the students or teachers discovering him? Where did he eat? Bathe? Did he ever get a change of clothes? What did he feed his dog? The owner of the school didn&#39;t think it was important to notify the police about finding a missing boy, but let him live in the basement indefinitely? :-) ). But we can let such unrealistic details slide and just enjoy the touching, fun, and slightly suspenseful (for me, anyway) story and wonderfully talented children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the scene with the mothers standing shoulder to shoulder on the steps barring the policemen from entering the school: I doubt they would get away with that nowadays. And I liked the nice touch about the boy Frankie stole from turning the tables on him (although that never really went anywhere), and Frankie&#39;s friends helping him out in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great movie for everyone!&#34;

b&#39;This program is a favorite of our family, and we feel it MUST be released on DVD by seasons!!! The title of &#34;Promised Land&#34; is very apt, as it is a positive statement about all the good that is left in this great country and the people who live in her! It\&#39;s a &#34;God Bless America&#34; type of program with inspiring stories, old-fashioned values, down-to-earth characters, truthful and encouraging messages, beautiful scenery, and well-written humor and drama. It\&#39;s a show the entire family is able to enjoy and benefit from--without worrying about bad language, &#34;adult&#34; themes, crudeness, violence, etc. We always felt blessed when we were done viewing an episode and can\&#39;t wait to see each one all over again when they\&#39;re finally released on DVD!&#39;

b&#39;Some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and/or as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens. YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look into two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and oneness only to be torn apart by the differences in the oneness between they\&#39;re pain. Death is explored figuratively and literally. It is what happens when ones soul is dead or similarly too alive, too awake to reality. It is the life NOT which you imagined behind the eyes of passer-by\&#39;s. This film explores the aching pain in us all, the frown beneath the cheery facade, the ache below. The ugly instinctual animalistic thoughts and acts become honest and matter of fact and then Bechard sprinkles a dash of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix knowing both linger in us all. Bechard, the writer, is a expert observer of the human condition and because of his non judgmental attitude presents life in a light we often shield our eyes from but yearn to see and understand. He, as director, focuses on the nuances of the actors spirit that shines through the character they\&#39;re playing to the actors own personal familiarity with the emotions brought on by each situation. This is the most accurately written and directed character portrayal of a man and woman\&#39;s experience together I have encountered as of yet, even though the two characters encounter is probably not the &#34;normal&#34; encounter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soundtrack encapsulates in each songs lyrics what the characters would let their hearts spill out if able and strong enough. It is each characters real voice sung through the beauty, pain, talent, and emotional intelligence of emerging indie artists ready to explode onto the alternative music market. The perfect soundtrack for those of us with issues - those of us who admit that we have issues and those of us that hide it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always enjoy exploring the darker sides of life with Mr. Bechard\&#39;s both fascinatingly creative and realistic view of life and the characters that revolve within it.&#39;

b&#34;The second in director Cohen&#39;s trilogy of Second World War comedies (the others being \xc2\x91Till Death Do Us Part&#39; and `Adolf Hitler - My Part In His Downfall&#39;) is a film version of the BBC&#39;s long running (and much loved) situation comedy. Like most transfers of television shows, this movie suffers from an absence of plot and is more a collection of sketches. Some of which work better than others for example the scene where a high ranking army officer floats down a river is a memorable, surreal moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The joy of this movie is it&#39;s representation of a past that probably never existed and an England which is defined by picturesque countryside and the chance it offers to see veteran scene-stealers such as John Le Mesurier given their biggest film roles. Arthur Lowe is superb as Captain Mainwaring, a bungler, who, when the chips are down, displays great courage and saves the day (the climax is probably the character&#39;s greatest moment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Episodes of the television series are of course funnier but as an introduction to a British legend, you cannot find anything better.&#34;

b&#34;I was very moved by the gentle power of this movie and by the mood it created. I think it should have gotten a great deal more credit than it did. I agree that Michelle Pfeiffer should have been nominated, but I think all the performances were outstanding, and that Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange portrayed the deep affinity and conflicts of sisters with great emotional depth and sensitivity. Although I didn&#39;t read the book, I found the modern concept of King Lear very cool. I certainly will never look at the play quite the same way again!&#34;

b&#34;Larisa Shepitko&#39;s THE ASCENT (1976) is an extraordinary, gruelling account of the partisans&#39; fight against the Nazis in German-occupied Belorussia, The Ascent reflects the Russian obsession with the horrors of the Great Patriotic War, but unusually is both steeped in religious symbolism and ready to acknowledge the existence of the less than great Russian collaborator. The true battle is not with the Nazis, who hover in the background as mere extras, but between the Russian Nazi investigator and Sotnikov, the captured partisan who finds the spiritual strength to go to his death unbeaten. With its many references to the Crucifixion, the story takes on heroic proportions glorifying the sufferings of the martyr and his influence on future generations. A remarkable piece of work.&#34;

b&#39;KRAMER VS KRAMER won five Oscars, including Best Picture of 1979. This intense and deeply moving family drama follows an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down when his wife of eight years, walks out on him, leaving him to care for his son and build a relationship with him he never had. Robert Benton\&#39;s incisive screenplay presents us flawed, but real human beings with hearts, souls, and brains. For instance, in the scene where Joanna announces to Ted she\&#39;s leaving him, she doesn\&#39;t just storm out the door...she gives him the keys, her credit cards, the dry cleaning ticket, tells him which bills have been paid, and informs him she has withdrawn from their bank account the same amount of money she had when they were married, no more. This decision to leave was not a whim...it was thought about and Joanna felt, with no other option than to leave, if she was leaving she was going to do it properly...and with no specific plan in mind, she did not think it right to take Billy. Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for his Ted Kramer, a man so obsessed with bringing home the bacon, he had no clue that his life at home was crumbling into pieces. Meryl Streep also won an Oscar playing Joanna, the unhappy wife who we feel sympathy for in the beginning of the film but that all changes when she returns for her son. Hoffman is at the top of his form here. I always tear up during the scene where he tries to explain to Billy (Justin Henry, Oscar nominee) why his mom left and he does it all in a stage whisper or when he meets Joanna upon her return and slams her drink into a wall (a Hoffman moment not in the script that Streep was not told about in order to get a natural reaction). Justin Henry hits all the right notes as Billy, the confused little boy who doesn\&#39;t know why his mom is gone and doesn\&#39;t know how to communicate with his father. Jane Alexander also got an Oscar nod as Ted and Joanna\&#39;s neighbor, Margaret, who has switched allegiances by the film\&#39;s conclusion. This is an intense family drama but there are laughs to be had here too...Billy and the chocolate chip ice cream...Billy pouting because Ted is late picking him for a party...Billy catching his dad\&#39;s one night stand (JoBeth Williams) on her way to the bathroom stark naked, but it\&#39;s the moments of human drama you remember...Ted running through Manhattan with Billy in his arms to get to the emergency room after BIlly falls off the jungle gym...Ted getting fired right before beginning his custody battle and instead of making a scene, he tells the guy in a whisper...&#34;Shame on you.&#34; And of course, the finale where Joanna tells Ted she\&#39;s not taking Billy, which I found a little hard to swallow. Why would she go to all that trouble of suing for custody and then just change her mind? But this is a small quibble regarding a wonderful movie, masterfully directed by Robert Benton and flawlessly performed by a top-notch cast. A must-see.&#39;

b&#34;When I first rented Batman Returns, I immediately thought it was going to be less than exceptional. I mean, Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so without him, how could there be a good movie? Simple, throw in Danny DeVito.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batman Returns is an arguably more dark movie than Batman. There are more villains here, less actual dark comedy in a lot of aspects, and more nerve-striking issues. However, the music is similar to the first if not darker. The scenery is definitely more depressing than the first, every detail right down to the time of year. This movie follows the same comic-style format we came to love in the first Batman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the performances. Michael Keaton thankfully returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne. He was great in the first movie, and just as much in this sequel. There was not enough screen time in the world for Keaton as Batman, need MORE! Danny DeVito gave an award-winning performance as The Penguin, the most grueling, disgusting, lovable, angry, evil, sad, pathetic villain ever to grace a superhero movie. You hate him so much yet feel so bad for him at the same time. And it explains him down to the last detail too, making it all the more conflicting. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as Catwoman/Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. She actually got a good amount of back story as well. Christopher Walken didn&#39;t disappoint as Max Shreck, the greedy, judgmental, selfish CEO of the power company. Michael Gough also thankfully returns as the lovable Alfred, and he was just as good here as well. Pat Hingle also returns as Gordon, although I feel he was really never in the spotlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With lots of great twists and sub-plots, Batman Returns is sure to please any fan of the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/10&#34;

b&#39;&#34;One True Thing&#34; is a very quiet film, that opened in the fall of 1998 to glowing reviews but mild box-office. It tells the crippled story of Ellen (Renee Zellweger), a workaholic who is forced to move back home to take care of her terminally ill mother (Meryl Streep), so that her aloof father (William Hurt) can run his academic department. These terms are only general. The strength of &#34;One True Thing&#34; lies in the way the actors elevate their characters above Hollywood clich\xc3\xa9 territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Streep is Kate, the perfect homemaker whose ability to light up a room with her charm is evident in her opening scenes at a costume party celebrating Hurt\&#39;s birthday. But Ellen has never been close to her mother, and since she graduated from Harvard University, has a certain destain about her- Ellen almost thinks her mother is a simplistic air-head. While on the other hand, she admires her father- who shares a special passion: Writing. Ellen writes for an aggressive New York firm, and is almost heartbroken when her latest piece is torn down by Hurt, who seems to be a very lonely figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get to the point, as Kate gets sicker, Ellen\&#39;s perspectives change and she grows closer to her mother and more distant to her father. Hurt keeps making excuses not to be there when the family needs him most, and Ellen assumes he\&#39;s having an affair. Meanwhile she\&#39;s given up her desk at work to spend time doing craft activities with her mother\&#39;s &#34;cult&#34; group The Minnies, and also learning that her mother isn\&#39;t as weak as she first assumed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without giving too much away, &#34;One True Thing&#34; is a masterpiece in character study. Streep once again turns in a beautiful performance, this time working on a subtle level that starts slow but ends with a brilliant speech on the vows of marriage. Streep earned her eleventh Oscar nomination for this performance. Hurt is also convincing as the father who carries a secret that isn\&#39;t revealed until the closing moments. But it is Renee Zellweger who steals this movie. Forget &#34;Chicago&#34;, &#34;Cold Mountain&#34;, &#34;Bridget Jones\&#39;s Diary&#34; or whatever else you\&#39;ve seen her do and rent this movie. She is remarkable in it. Working within her character\&#39;s bitter resentment at understanding her parents, Zellweger manages a realistic portrayal of a young woman fighting to keep her lip up while she\&#39;s screaming inside.&#39;

b&#34;Yes I AM a FF7 fan, but how many people who watch this movie are NOT going to be? And so, I&#39;m reviewing this movie from a FF7 fan perspective, and with no regret. (I would not know how to adequately review the movie for someone who has not played the FF7 game.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visuals - 10/10 I loved Advent Children. It&#39;s a sensory delight - a complete audio-video overload. The visuals were breathtaking: some feats were accomplished that I would simply have not quite thought possible with an animated feature. When the action scenes came about, they were, for lack of a more accurate word, a roller-coaster. With dramatic camera movement sweeping across from range to range, to seamlessly integrated bullet-time effects at the crucial moments, to the sheer level of detail - it&#39;s all hard to fault. The animation looks big budget, the style and imagery is awesome, and the effects at times made me forget that I was watching animation rather than live action footage. I could ramble on for hours repeating myself on the fantastic quality of the visuals, but it simply wouldn&#39;t do it any justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound - 10/10 The sound was fabulous. The voices for all the characters didn&#39;t disappoint (no one sounded silly) and the sound effects were bold and sharp. The music - from the game that (in my opinion) had the best game soundtrack EVER, transfered beautifully to the movie. Most of the memorable themes from the game are present in the movie, albeit often using different instruments to fit in better with what&#39;s going on. There was some bolder rock and slight thrash metal music over the really intense action scenes from time to time, but it all fitted in well with the movie&#39;s situation at the corresponding time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Story - 7/10 The story and characters would be the main flaws of the movie. Both aspects were simply not up to par with the game - but then again, the game could spend 40+ hours developing these points - the movie only has about 90 minutes. As far as the story goes, the plot wasn&#39;t bad or anything, but just not as ambitious as was expected from someone who played the game through. In effect, the plot seemed rather weak in comparison. The game was so extravagant with the intricate plot twists and story progression/development, that the movie never really stood a chance to compete in the same league. Instead, the movie took the more sensible approach - to expand on the action and try to place as many inside-jokes and themes into itself instead of trying to impossibly recreate the massive story factor, which was originally such a driving force in the game. The lack of Materia usage also caused me some controversy - the story of the movie chose to use little (though not ZERO) Materia, and instead lots of supernatural fighting ability and skill. I would hope that if a sequel was made it would incorporate Materia much much more extravagantly and importantly into the film. There were also many plot holes in the movie - all which can be forgiven if you think of Advent Children as a random anime, but seem ridiculous when you realise how it was based on a game that executed plot tremendously well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Characters - 7/10 The characters, whilst all being present in one form or another, don&#39;t necessarily shine to their true potential. There simply isn&#39;t really enough movie-time to spend with all of them. And so, all of their background stories and abilities are not entirely showcased, and in some cases, barely at all (Red and Cait Sith leave absolutely no real lasting impressions). Even Cloud, who is the focal point of the movie, I feel doesn&#39;t use enough of his familiar abilities from the game. The Materia issue is a strong reason for this. With that said, it&#39;s a joy to see the cast back in action, even if it&#39;s in such a role that doesn&#39;t utilise them to their fullest. The new characters were the ones that caused me most of the strife however - the Bad Guy Trio and the kid dude Denzel - there was a huge lack of explanation about any of them. Anyone willing to use their imagination can probably fill in the blanks with something reasonable and be done with it, but objectively speaking the issue is still there to be commented on and is therefore a little disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value - 10/10 The replay value for this movie is excellent - I personally want to watch it again in a more bigger and louder way - bigger screen, louder volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoyment - 10/10 Whatever the flaws of the movie, they simply weren&#39;t big enough to hinder my enjoyment of it, and I honestly think that will be the same case for most people. I enjoyed Advent Children tremendously, and encourage fellow FF7 fans to go see it.&#34;

b&#39;&#34;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&#34; (aka &#34;Doppelganger&#34;) is an entertaining, Twilight Zone-style sci-fi offering from Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (the team behind Space: 1999, UFO, Thunderbirds, Fireball XL-5 and others). In the film, Roy Thinnes (of the &#34;Invaders&#34; TV show) and Ian Hendry star as astronauts sent on a flight to a planet which shares an exact orbit of the earth, but on the opposite side of the sun; hence previously hidden from view. A pushy European space flight director (over-acted by the late Patrick Wymark) gets the flight fast-tracked and after rigorous training , the astronauts are good to go. Thus begins the best sequences in the film, the launch, flight and landing on the \&#39;other\&#39; earth. Dazzling rocket miniature work (by Derek Meddings) and a dream-like, elegant spaceflight (somewhat reminiscent of the best moments of &#34;2001: A Space Odyssey&#34;) are easy highlights of the movie. The landing on the &#34;doppelganger&#34; earth is both exciting and eerie. After this, the Twilight Zone aspect of the film kicks in; with a plot lifted almost whole from the classic TZ episode, &#34;The Parallel.&#34; That aside, the film is still solid sci-fi, with some intriguing \&#39;mirror-world\&#39; stuff to chew on (backwards writing and left-handed handshakes, for example). Less successful are the scenes depicting a mid-21st century earth; where all the men wear turtlenecks and Nehru jackets and all the women wear mini-skirts. Some of the relationships with women in the film are very \&#39;non-PC\&#39; by today\&#39;s standards as well. And (in the most consistent failing of most 20th century sci-fi) the computers, telephones and other hardware are all big, colorful and clunky (right out of Patrick McGoohan\&#39;s &#34;The Prisoner&#34;). No one foresaw the digital microprocessor age! If one can accept these failings in foresight, the movie is very interesting, with a solid lead performance by Thinnes as the troubled astronaut. And with a nice, 1960s/early \&#39;70s style nihilistic ending! For fans of retro sci-fi (like myself) this is a &#34;Journey&#34; worth taking!&#39;

b&#34;They just don&#39;t make cartoons like they used to. This one had wit, great characters, and the greatest ensemble of voice over artists ever assembled for a daytime cartoon show. This still remains as one of the highest rated daytime cartoon shows, and one of the most honored, winning several Emmy Awards.&#34;

b&#39;I really loved this movie. I thought it was very well done. The character interaction was wonderfully done as was the characterization. The actors were definitely believable. The plot was very deep and intriguing. Even though parts of it are a bit slow and sometimes a bit boring, it\&#39;s definitely worth watching several times. The chemistry between the three main actors was great. If you don\&#39;t want to watch it for that, then at least watch it for the drama between the characters. I mean, the whole thing was just &#34;Whoa!&#34; It was like I couldn\&#39;t look away. The whole movie grabbed my attention and kept my interest, even through the slow parts. I loved this movie and almost everything about it. I loved the ending because it was so interesting and, if you watch the movie a second time, makes perfect sense. But I\&#39;m not spoiling anything.&#39;

b&#39;This is a classic continuation to Bleu, the likewise excellent film, with Juliet Binouche as a main star, moreover, she is a cameo appearance here, in Rouge, just for a second at the very end. But this film, truly red and very sweet although very sad, is a real winner. The main heroine, played by ever great Irene Jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model. She leads a full, active life, only darkened by her traumatic relations with her weird friend Mike, who is in England. By some lucky chance, she gets friendly with the old Judge, who spends time listening to the private telephone talks of his neighbors. The story starts to weave even further, and we see him in court, being almost universally condemned for his pastime. She is the only one who feels sympathy for him, for his cute doggy Rita and her pups, and for all the people who surround them. We also witness the break-up of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his lady, and their quarrel is also fueled by that telephone scandal... But the film is not about this, even. It is mostly about the loneliness and deep rifts between people, far and near. When she sails to England on a ferry, with that lawyer as a chance fellow-passenger, as well as that earlier mentioned Binoche who starred in Bleu, the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of The Judge when he watches the news trying to guess if she survived. She did, and still we feel very heavy at heart. Mr. Kislowski managed to draw a grand, subtle story about the solitude, misunderstanding, secrets and pain. Deep, dark personal pain of those who are lost and lonely. Brilliant film.&#39;

b&#34;Talking about competition features at the Split Film festival, we have titles from all over the world. China, Korea, Canada, USA and Australia and many of these stories are indicating that the world is really valley of tears. Modern love...thats for sure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that movie by Alex Frayne, two younger married people and their boy are traveling from town to the coast to visit the grave and house of the man&#39;s uncle who raised him a long time ago and who died in mysterious circumstances. The coastal village seems like something in an American horror film where the village is bizarre and people are uncommon mutants. But episodes in Alex Frayne&#39;s pastorella can&#39;t be described as horror in the normal way. In fact this is an extreme interesting drama where we are seeing relationships and horror through flashbacks and much more. In this story and through obviously psychological facets of the actors we are shown a peep show of film some charmingly eccentric Australian film-making. Thus is the the case of Frayne. Always something new and fresh. Visual intelligence and unique sensibility of some Australian directors is astonishing good. Frayne&#39;s movie is super. There is something in the Australian landscape that shows their movies so special as we have see in FRAYNE&#39;s Modern Love and in RAY Lawrence movies Lantana and Jindabyne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems it will be the same in future titles of Alex Frayne.&#34;

b&#39;I am a history teacher and overall I was pleased with the movie. My teen-agers enjoyed it over the holidays. Is it 100% accurate and is it a little sappy in places? Yes..but it took my kids away from the computer and play station to spend four nights watching it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battle scenes were impressive and we met plenty of historical characters throughout. Lloyd Bridges as Jefferson Davis and Hal Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln stand out. We all thought Phillip Casnoff as Bent was evilly and charmingly brilliant. We all thought Charles stole the show from Orry and George.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will enjoy the movie again!&#39;

b&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Long Kiss Goodnight is yet another prime example of a common affliction of many modern films; it starts off on a very interesting concept - a trained assassin whose memory was erased regains consciousness of herself - and the initial setup is engaging but then it seems the writers don&#39;t know very well where to go next and the whole thing trails off down increasingly confusing and/or inane paths, leaving the disappointing taste of something that was OK but promised to be a lot better. The baddies are remarkably unremarkable, and even Jackson&#39;s comic sidekick turn seems more like something from his pre-Pulp Fiction days; it looks like Harlin, as in Cutthroat Island, made every effort so that no-one would upstage his then wife. Her character is by far the best of the film and this fact only makes you feel even more frustrated that they weren&#39;t able to do something better with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is still something about this film which for me sets it apart from the run-of-the-mill hollywood actioner and places it above average, if only just. It is something very subtle I can&#39;t quite put my finger on; it&#39;s a disturbing, cold, dark, even sickly edge, a nightmarish and unreal feel, a decadent air, a mean streak, which keeps cropping up in various ways. It&#39;s in the dark reddish photography and almost permanent night the characters dwell in, it&#39;s in Samantha&#39;s dreams in front of the mirror, it&#39;s in her vicious eyes and smile whenever she&#39;s about to kill a man or when she announces how she will enjoy watching her nemesis die with her daughter listening, it&#39;s in Mitch&#39;s comeback at the wheel of a car while he is spurting so much blood from his mouth he can hardly speak... I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s an atmosphere, something I can&#39;t define but which gives me the creeps (a bit) and which makes this film still oddly intriguing for me.&#34;

b&#34;I have copied my video of this on to DVD so that I can enjoy it whenever I like and it makes a very successful (and rare) wedding present as well! This is just an absolutely wonderful adaptation of a much loved novel. Everything about it is just perfect and it has aged amazingly well. There is always a chance with something this old that it might appear a bit creaky next to more modern dramas but &#39;Precious Bane&#39; more than holds its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the acting is amazing with Janet McTeer making a superlative Prudence and a young Clive Owen stomping around as the taciturn Gideon Sarn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I challenge anyone to watch the final sequence without at least sniffling a little at the sheer romance of it all. It is the perfect film to watch when it is cold outside and you are snuggled up on the sofa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#39;t recommend this highly enough.&#34;

b&#39;Okay so there were the odd hole in the plot you could drive a zeppelin through, but how well was the emotional stuff handled? It would have been so easy to descend into cheesiness but the writer pulled it off. The image of the ex female cyberman making crying noises as she/it saw her reflection after regaining her emotions is one that will stay with me forever. That\&#39;s twice now the monsters have shown a soft side and been presented fleetingly sympathetically, the previous being the last Dalek from series one, but by Jove it\&#39;s worked. Add to that the other ex-female who had been &#34;upgraded&#34; on the eve of her wedding, and Jackie Tyler recognising her husband after she had become &#34;cyber&#34; and you have a permanent throat lump. Keep it up!&#39;

b&#34;I would have to say that in general Barbie Movies have impressed me. I have a 5 year old Barbie fanatic niece and she watches them all the time so needless to say I have seen quite a lot of Barbie these holidays, but I am not sick of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film, visually, has a lot to offer, especially the backgrounds, and the animation of the characters has improved with each new movie. One thing I noticed in particular was a vast improvement in the animation of Barbie&#39;s hair in this film. It has a lovely range of excerpts from classical music and I think that this is great, as it exposes a new generation to the classics. This film is well worth ago, especially if you have young relievers. They will be entertained for hours!&#34;

b&#34;First of all, I must say that I love this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the first film that I saw from director Micheal Haneke and I was impressed that how good the direction was good !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haneke surely knows how to direct actors. What I found intresting is also Haneke&#39;s scenario. At first, you saw a woman who is very straight and seems to be a good piano teacher and very well loved and respected from everybody in her entourage. Then you realise that she has a mother who is a controle freak and is too much present in her life. Now you know that she is deranged, that she has emotional problems, but you don&#39;t know exactly what. And then you fall into her dark side, but her dark side is only reveal when a student sendenly fall in love with her. She can&#39;t controled herself anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roles are very complexed and difficult to play, but Isabelle Huppert is marvellous in her role and she deserves the recognition she had at Cannes Festival. Benoit Maginel is very solid too, but a little bit eclipse by Huppert&#39;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one thing that I found strange in the scenario is how the character played by Magimel is not very credible. He is too talented! It is rare that a person is a piano virtuoso, but pass the most of the his time to play hockey and study... It think that it is a weak point, but only a minor flaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just saw the movie once, so I can&#39;t do a very complete critic, because I didn&#39;t analysed the movie. I like what I saw ! so I give the film a 8.5/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah... as for the end, Haneke showed that he really wanted to shock his audience. A motivation that don&#39;t think is necessary to make movies, but Haneke does it with style and precision, that is why his film is better than Baise-Moi for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vince&#34;

b&#39;It\&#39;s up there with Where\&#39;s Poppa, The Groove Tube, Putney Swope. It memorializes the NY city mind set of the period, a wonderfully strange man with a bizarre plan, hoist by by own petard, and at last retreating into the bed of his adoptive parents. Totally absurd, its the life one sees through the magic glasses, seeing things as they &#34;really are&#34;... I don\&#39;t think it is ever shown anymore. If so, surely someone would Tivo the thing and put it out there. A kidnap goes awry: mixed up in a rain storm, dashing in and out or storefronts, our hero tosses a raincoat over his prey and tossing her into his bicycle powered ice cream wagon spirits her off to his basement apartment in the village. He is amazed, surprised, and incredibly disappointed when the wraps come off: instead of a luscious lady, he has captures a middle ages suburban housewife who talks and talks and talks. The film is full of vignettes of the commuters life, the suburban life, the city officials, and all the attitudes so dearly held. It pushes the limits of comedy, such as magical reality might push a drama, much as Daffy Duck is able to draw on imaginative scenes to demonstrate his plight or desires, all at the very edge of plausibility. All of it is humorous, nobody is mean.&#39;

b&#34;One of the most magnificent movies ever made. The acting of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) is simply outstanding. This is the crown on the career of director Winner, who himself was often quoted saying this was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied many times, but it&#39;s never been topped. Wildey J. Moore, the gun manufacturer, many times claimed his brand&#39;s growth since the mid 80s can be fully credited to DW3, and rightly so. This is not just a movie, this is art that many generations will admire and appreciate. Although this movie has never been fully appreciated in the USA, it has found a huge following in Europe and Asia, where the movie is regularly shown at film schools and it is still a popular hit in student cinemas all across Europe. All in all, a true classic.&#34;

b&#39;I too must apologize for a somewhat biased opinion of this endeavor as I contributed to the soundtrack. Still I received my copy, sat back and enjoyed the rolling cast of characters who were perhaps more colorful than the characters they were creating in this tale of a film sequel shanghai. For those who feel George Bush is a &#34;credible Texan&#34;, one need look no further than this film to shatter the image that Texas is full of truck driving, one-dimensional rednecks. The cast contains some of the most intelligent, peculiar and humorous folks you\&#39;ll find anywhere as they spin their tales of agony, bliss and disappointment in going for a great film sequel, no budget, guerilla style (i.e. &#34;punk rock style&#34; as each person helps define).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great documentary made with passion and guts and all the venom you\&#39;ll need to break through to the other side of whatever industry b.s. and doublespeak you\&#39;re dealing with (take note authors, painters, musicians and fellow filmmakers). It hearkens back to the credibility of the first wave of American hardcore music when the term &#34;D.I.Y.&#34; was the standard, a period where courage, passion and commitment mattered way more than technique, style or precious calculations. Not that there isn\&#39;t plenty of technique or style to this...the tone of the documentary is quite refreshing. The editing cuts provide as much drama as the dialog therein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of creating a documentary out of the sad demise of the cast, crew and director\&#39;s initial intent is brilliant, totally Texas and absolutely punk rock. In the truest sense of the term.&#39;

b&#39;I saw this series on PBS in 1980 in college and I still can\&#39;t get it out of my head, although I have never seen it since. I remember every cast member (the casting WAS perfect, as mentioned in other comments), the design, the lighting and, of course, the story, which is by itself is enough to keep you glued to the set. Probably the best TV series I ever saw next to the original &#34;Roots.&#34;&#39;

b&#34;This is not a &#39;real&#39; James Cagney vehicle since his screen time is unusually slim. Frankie Darro plays tough kid Jimmy Smith, the leader of a gang of street thugs that is sent to reform school with a few of his hoodlum friends. Cagney plays Patsy Gargan, a gang leader himself, who is given a token position as a deputy commissioner. When he finds out first hand of the brutal treatment dished out at the reform school, he is compelled to make some major changes with the help of the reformatory nurse(Madge Evans). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE MAYOR of HELL is fast paced and is still entertaining after all these years.

b&#34;Though I strongly feel that SITR is the best Gene Kelly movie, but this a pretty good one. I liked the music and the dancing and the ending on how Gene got the girl. My favorite part though without a doubt is Gene&#39;s dance with his alter ego. I love watching two Gene Kelly&#39;s for the price of one. It shows what talent Mr. Kelly really was. It is a movie that I think that everyone should watch at least once in their life time. So you have not seen it go out and find to watch it today! I&#39;m sure that everyone out there has a Gene Kelly friend that has this movie in their collection. So go over to their house and pop some popcorn and enjoy!&#34;

b&#39;The 1970s are often regarded as a golden age of British television comedy, a period which saw numerous classic sitcoms as well as sketch shows such as &#34;Monty Python\&#39;s Flying Circus&#34;. The period was, however, emphatically not a golden age of British film comedy, and what worked well on television rarely transferred successfully to the big screen. The most triumphant exceptions to this rule were provided by the Pythons, but their best films (&#34;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&#34; and &#34;Life of Brian&#34;) were very different in conception to their TV show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem with adapting sitcoms for the cinema is that concepts devised to fit the BBC\&#39;s 30 minute slots (25 minutes on ITV, which has to find room for commercials) do not always work as well when expanded into a feature film three or four times as long. Few people will remember the film versions of, say, &#34;Up Pompeii!&#34; or &#34;Steptoe and Son&#34; with the same affection as the television versions. In the case of many classic TV comedy shows (&#34;Some Mothers Do \&#39;Ave \&#39;Em&#34;, &#34;Yes, Minister&#34;, &#34;Fawlty Towers&#34;, &#34;The Goodies&#34;) no attempt was made to film them at all, for which we can be grateful. Characters such as Michael Crawford\&#39;s Frank Spencer or John Cleese\&#39;s Basil Fawlty can be hilarious in half-hour doses, but I doubt if they would remain as funny over two hours. One comedy programme (albeit a dramatisation of a comic novel rather than a sitcom in the normal sense) which might have worked in the cinema was &#34;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&#34;, but any hopes of a film were dashed by the tragically early death of its star Leonard Rossiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Dad\&#39;s Army&#34; was one of the few television sitcoms of the period which was turned into a decent film. (About the only other one I can think of was &#34;Porridge&#34;). This was possibly because it had an unusually large number of well-developed characters and derived most of its humour from the interactions between them. The original sitcom ran between 1968 and 1977 and told of the misadventures of a Home Guard platoon in the small seaside town of Walmington-on-Sea. (The Home Guard, initially known as the Local Defence Volunteers, was an auxiliary militia during World War II made up, for the most part, of men too old to serve in the regular forces). The film version is a three-act drama. Act I deals with the formation of the platoon and the recruitment of its members. In Act II they cause havoc during an Army training exercise. In Act III they succeed in capturing a group of Nazi airmen whose plane has been shot down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three key players in this drama are the platoon\&#39;s commander, Captain George Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe), and his two subordinates Sergeant Arthur Wilson (John Le Mesurier) and Corporal Jack Jones (Clive Dunn). Mainwaring, who in civilian life is the local bank manager, is a fussy little man, peering at the world through a pair of thick spectacles. It is he who takes the initiative in forming the Home Guard unit and who appoints himself its commander. He is pompous, officious, with an exaggerated sense of his own importance and of his own powers of leadership, the sort of man who does not suffer fools gladly. (And in George Mainwaring\&#39;s world-view the term &#34;fool&#34; covers most of the rest of the human race). He does, however, have his good qualities. He is motivated by a genuine patriotic idealism and is capable of great physical courage, shown in his encounter with the Germans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wilson is Mainwaring\&#39;s deputy at the bank. The two men are very different in character, something emphasised by a difference in appearance, Wilson being tall and thin whereas Mainwaring is short and stout. He comes across as being both more intelligent and better educated than his boss. (His accent suggests he may be a former public schoolboy). Nevertheless, he has ended up playing second fiddle both in civilian and military life, probably because he has the sort of passive personality which leads to pessimism and defeatism and an inability to take anything altogether seriously. Jones is an old soldier who now runs the local butcher\&#39;s shop. (His promotion to Corporal is due mainly to his ability to bribe Mainwaring with black market sausages). His enthusiasm for his new role is matched only by his incompetence and ability to cause chaos. Although his catchphrase is &#34;Don\&#39;t panic!&#34; he is prone to panicking at any given opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several other members of the platoon are featured. Private Fraser, the dour Scottish undertaker, is even more of a pessimist than Wilson. (Catchphrase: &#34;We\&#39;re doomed, man, DOOMED!&#34;). Private Godfrey is a gentle old man whose main concern is the whereabouts of the nearest lavatory. Private Walker is a sharp Cockney spiv and Private Pike (another bank employee) a spoilt mummy\&#39;s boy. (Pike\&#39;s mother is Wilson\&#39;s mistress, although Wilson tries to keep this liaison secret from the disapproving Mainwaring). Two significant outsiders are the mild-mannered Vicar and the ARP warden, Mainwaring\&#39;s detested enemy and quite his equal in pompousness and officiousness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are occasional bawdy doubles entendres (&#34;Keep your hands off my privates&#34;- Mainwaring is ostensibly referring to those soldiers who hold that rank), more so than in the television show which was surprisingly free of innuendo. (Its creators, David Croft and Jimmy Perry, would later go on to create comedy shows such as &#34;Are You Being Served?&#34; and &#34;Hi-de-hi&#34; which were notorious for suggestive humour). The film does, however, preserve much of the mixture of gentle wit, nostalgia and sharp characterisation which made the TV series so successful. 7/10&#39;

b&#39;Michael Kehoe has accomplished quite a feat, especially considering it is only his second start as writer, producer AND director. Generally &#34;first timers&#34; lack vision and direction when helming a major production but &#34;Dominion&#34; proves Mr. Kehoe is going places in Hollywood! Set with beautiful scenery, Dominion boasts experienced cast members (especially Thomerson &amp; James) who communicate Kehoe\&#39;s vast vision with exceptional clarity. Few films can mix the slasher/horror genre with a genuine action/adventure feel, but Dominion accomplished this completely. This film certainly qualifies as one of the top-notch films in both of these categories. If you are looking for fast-paced action with more than a modicum of suspense, look no further. I look forward to Kehoe\&#39;s future projects with great enthusiasm. Well done!!!&#39;

b&#39;Spoiler Alert - although this is a plot almost as impossible to spoil as it is to completely explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\&#39;Mulholland Drive\&#39; is by far the most successful expression of David Lynch\&#39;s cinematographic style and vision since the first season of his \&#39;Twin Peaks\&#39; TV series. As Lynch enthusiasts know, his is a style and vision uniquely blended from film noir, horror movies, surrealism, and parapsychology \xc2\x96 with a healthy dose of postmodern self-consciousness and black humor thrown in for good measure. All these elements are richly at work in \&#39;Mulholland Drive,\&#39; making for a riveting, hair-raising, and highly satisfying film experience \xc2\x96 especially if one does not become overly obsessed with trying to make all the plot pieces fit into a logical, mystery-unraveling whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film features wonderful performances by Naomi Watts and Laura Harring in the lead roles of young women whose lives intersect in various ways amid a Hollywood setting that is itself an hallucinated blend of contemporary reality, retro \&#39;50s nostalgia, and satirical self-aggrandizement. Their seemingly random initial meeting occurs after the film\&#39;s opening scene, in which Harring\&#39;s character escapes an attempt on her life thanks to a fortuitous, not to mention horrific, automobile accident. Staggering down the hillside from Mulholland Drive to Sunset Boulevard (the two most archetypal of Hollywood thoroughfares), she finds her way to the very apartment that Betty (Naomi Watts) is about to sublet from her \&#39;Aunt Ruth,\&#39; a purportedly successful actress who is off to Canada to begin a new movie. As we later learn, Betty had herself arrived from Deep River, Ontario, shortly after winning a jitterbug contest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A highly energetic and stylized flashback to the contest forms one of two pre-credit prologue sequences that frame Betty\&#39;s descent from the clich\xc3\xa9d would-be-starlet\&#39;s bright-eyed innocence to the debauched madness of spurned lover and going nowhere bit-part actress. Unable to remember her own name, the Harring character adopts the name \&#39;Rita\&#39; from a movie poster for the film noir classic \&#39;Gilda\&#39; that adorns Aunt Ruth\&#39;s apartment. (Actually, it turns out Aunt Ruth has long since deceased and whose apartment we\&#39;re really in is a good question to be resolved in future viewings.) Anyway, Betty determines to help Rita find out what happened and to discover the source of the rolls of cash and a mysterious blue key that the women find in Rita\&#39;s purse. The two women begin to piece together clues that would seem to lead to Rita\&#39;s true identity. They also, by the way, become lovers, at one point radiating such an incendiary chemistry that I cannot recall its equal in mainstream treatments of Lesbian lover affairs (if a Lynch movie can ever be designated \&#39;mainstream\&#39;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the local Winkies restaurant (a recurring location fraught with dream-like significance behind its grubby realistic facade), Rita\&#39;s attention is caught by a waitress\&#39;s name-tag reading \&#39;Diane.\&#39; This leads her to a recollection of someone named \&#39;Diane Selwyn,\&#39; whose apartment the two women soon visit and, at Betty\&#39;s insistence, break into. I won\&#39;t reveal what they find within, but suffice it to say the scene is rendered with vintage Lynchian creepiness. Subsequently, Rita wakes in night sweats speaking Spanish and hurrying Betty to an all-night magic show/theater called \&#39;Silencio,\&#39; where the arts of illusion and lip/instrumental- syncing are practiced with manic intensity and where the Blue- Haired Lady, as she is noted in the end credits, reigns as the presiding Muse. Framed by the blue-lit, red-curtained Silencio Theatre, the blue-haired lady occupies the last shot in the film, perhaps a symbol for the controlling artistic imagination \xc2\x96 rather like Steven\&#39;s &#34;man with the blue guitar&#34; as filtered through bad- drug surrealism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the Silencio sequence, and as Rebekah Del Rio cameo lip-syncs her own powerful Spanish rendition of Roy Orbison\&#39;s \&#39;Crying\&#39;), a shattering epiphany occurs when Betty opens her own purse to discover a blue box with a keyhole that obviously matches the key in Rita\&#39;s purse. Even if we do not delve too deeply into the Freudian sexual symbolism of purses, the moment is a singularly Hitchcockian one in that the matching of the key and box leads to a complete inversion of what we thought we knew and into a whole new set of character relationships and meanings. Not the least of these reversals is the discovery that Betty is the sought-for Diane Selwyn and the spurned lover of Camilla Rhodes (i.e. Rita). Camilla in turn is a Latin femme fatale movie star to whom Diane is indebted for the few minor roles she has managed to secure and, more significantly, to whom she is emotionally subjugated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After these and other discoveries in the last third of the film, the problem of accounting for the first two thirds of the movie is not so straightforwardly resolved as in \&#39;Vertigo.\&#39; While bits and pieces of imagery and dialog suggest that much, if not all, of the earlier material is projected and displaced from the fevered subconscious of Diane herself, other bits and pieces suggest the perhaps supernatural intervention of a cast of characters drawing direct inspiration from \&#39;Twin Peaks,\&#39; including Michael J. Anderson reprising his unearthly dwarfish powers and a Bob- variant who hangs out behind Winkies and is the ultimate repository for the blue box and its id-like associations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However one fits the pieces together, though, the whole of \&#39;Mulholland Drive\&#39; is much greater \xc2\x96 and more mysterious \xc2\x96 than the sum of its parts. Lynch takes us on a wonderfully inventive, provocative, and pleasurably disturbing mind trip. What\&#39;s more, the film\&#39;s cinematography is stunning, the soundtrack filled with evocative atmospherics, the acting superb, and the directing /editing masterful. This may well have been the unacknowledged Best Picture of 2001 among major American releases.&#39;

The next focus is Charles\&#39; artistic evolution as a Nat King Cole-like singer, to his arrangements of gospel music, his foray into country music, and the unique sound that became Ray Charles. The third focus is Charles\&#39; personal life - his marriage to Bea, his many affairs, his heroin addiction and eventual rehabilitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Charles lived a packed 74 years, there\&#39;s a lot skipped. Though Charles was orphaned while in his teens, the death of his beloved mother, his rock, isn\&#39;t in the film. While he is shown on the chitlin circuit and refusing to play in segregated clubs, his near-starvation as a musician isn\&#39;t covered. At one point, he found a jar of jelly and attempted to eat it, but the jar broke. He was that down and out. Bea is shown with him when the State of Georgia, which banned him, adopts &#34;Georgia on My Mind&#34; as their theme song in 1979 and welcomes Charles back to his native state, yet he and Bea were divorced in 1977 which isn\&#39;t mentioned. She probably was there, however. Also, she wasn\&#39;t his only wife - he was married once before he met her; that marriage isn\&#39;t covered. In the movie, we\&#39;re told of one illegitimate child - there were 12. It would have been impossible to get all of that and more into a film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What isn\&#39;t skipped is his glorious music, which seems to go on constantly throughout the film, continually reinforcing his genius and artistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles\&#39; story is compelling and holds the audience\&#39;s interest throughout. Those who scoff at it as a made-for-TV movie don\&#39;t give it the credit it deserves. Taylor Hackford\&#39;s direction gives &#34;Ray&#34; a good pace, and the movie has a lot of atmosphere and evokes the various decades beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Ray, Jamie Foxx inhabits the character and makes one forget he\&#39;s a comedian playing a part. Foxx wore prosthetics, did his own piano playing, and spent a great deal of time with Charles preparing for the role. He nails him, but it\&#39;s not an impersonation - he\&#39;s a flesh and blood man with hallucinations of standing in water and finding his brother\&#39;s body; a man full of denial about his addiction, hating the word junkie and believing he\&#39;s not hooked; and he\&#39;s in denial about his home life, thinking that his wife doesn\&#39;t know about his various affairs and illegitimate children (in the movie, child); and a man taken terrible advantage of early in his career because of his blindness who refuses to be walked on later on. He demands to be paid in $1 bills so they can be counted; when he discovers he\&#39;s a gravy train for a club owner and her partner and was nearly cheated out of a record deal, he makes his own deal and leaves his job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One doesn\&#39;t so much marvel at Foxx\&#39;s performance as accept him as Ray from the first time he appears on camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent biography, which, like &#34;Walk the Line&#34; is punctuated with the fantastic music of the artist. Whether or not you\&#39;re a Ray Charles fan, &#34;Ray&#34; is something to experience.&#39;

b&#34;I saw this movie at a screener and its the best movie I have seen in a loooong time. I loved it!!!! James Franco is sooo hot and him and Sienna Miller make the perfect couple. I don&#39;t want to give away what happens but they play a pair of newlyweds who go off on their honeymoon to Niagara Falls and some pretty wild stuff happens along the way....The movie is really really funny and sad and original. I can&#39;t even say what it reminded me of, but go see it! I cried so hard but really loved it and wanna see it again as soon as it comes out! My friends cried too. I hope it comes out soon - does anyone know when? i would really go see it if i were you&#34;

b&#39;I just picked this up in a decent if not outstanding DVD version for one dollar at Wal Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Run out and buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m fairly sure that this version is the short, incomplete version released against the animator\&#39;s wishes in the late Fifties, but even so, at a buck it\&#39;s an *incredible* bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film was syndicated in small chunks as a serial to local TV stations in the early 60s for the kid\&#39;s shows that almost every station ran on weekday afternoons in those days - &#34;Mr Bill and Bozo&#34;, &#34;Monty\&#39;s Gang&#34; (Channel 4, Greenville SC) and &#34;Captain Grady&#34; (channel 13, Asheville NC - which is where i saw it). It made such an impression on twelve-or-so-old me that i immediately recognised it when i spotted it in Wal Mart tonight and grabbed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful. You should get it.&#39;

b&#39;I won\&#39;t go to a generalization, and say it\&#39;s the best love story of all time, as some have said. That\&#39;s fine, people feel very deeply about this film, you either love it I believe...or you simply hate it. I don\&#39;t want to say, the best of all,because that is simply too \&#39;broad\&#39; for me to make a statement like that. However, I feel very passionately about The English Patient, as well as millions of other people do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The awards say it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t agree with critics, on many levels, however, the ones that picked this one, I couldn\&#39;t agree more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9-Oscars. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;41-wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;37-other nominations, makes this love story,on the top of the bunch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the director, Anthony Minghella, the story that bursts onto the screen and as Mr. Peterman (from T.V.s Seinfeld) said, &#34;Elaine, I simply can\&#39;t take my eyes off of it!&#34; In this instance, I don\&#39;t agree with Elaine\&#39;s response. But the story builds and takes the right time, needed to make it\&#39;s case beautifully. The cinematography,(John Seale) won multiple awards as well, as it ought too. I have not really paid much attention to Juliette Binoche, until now. Well, not entirely true I loved her performance in &#34;Sabrina&#34; Lovely story of a somewhat complicated relationship, next to Harrison Ford. But this was simply an incredibly differing character for her, and as deeply talented as she is, she simply shined in her own subtle and graceful way, she was just what this film was looking for, I\&#39;m truly glad that it was her performance and not another actress. Ralph Fiennes, was also spectacular in portraying Count Laszlo De Almasy. I had a new respect for his ability, after seeing this one! What can you say except, see this picture again. (*****)&#39;

b&#34;Hummmm,...ANOTHER Keystone comedy set in the park!!! It seems that the number one location spot for shooting was in this same local park, as so many of Chaplin&#39;s and Arbuckle&#39;s films are set there! And, while this is yet another one, it is different enough and well made that I still enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fatty is interested in a younger than usual looking and acting Mabel Normand. I think she&#39;s supposed to be a little younger, though in her mother&#39;s eyes she is TOO YOUNG to be interested in men. Well, Fatty does not share her feelings and soon he and Mabel run away for some innocent fun. Things get complicated when the mother&#39;s watch is stolen. Fatty finds it and gives it to Mabel as a gift,...and MANY problems result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent pacing and the fact that this movie did not rely too much on cheap slapstick but a reasonable plot make this a cute and enjoyable little film.&#34;

b&#34;It is movie about love,violence,illegal affairs and romanian tycoons. A romanian story combined with an occidental adaption resulting in a modern international film that can be understood both by western audiences but as well by eastern European audiences that HAVE LONG forgotten about the conservative comunist regim over film-making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A film full of violent fight scenes that are very numerous and create more and more tensed situations as the movie goes on . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A story that impresses because of its view over the hard life from the neighbourhood. Two young men do illegal car races. They work together as a team and prosper from their occupation ,but when they are asked by a local tycoon to lose one race things start to get messy and the fuse from the bomb lights up creating a very tensionated movie that will keep you close to the screen until the ending of it when you will still be asking yourself a lot of questions long after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliant acting both by Dragos Bucur and Dorina Chiriac along with high quality directing and screen writing by the young but talented director Radu Muntean also give a unique charm to Furia. All this and many other elements that can be noticed while watching have created a must see movie by all the filmlovers around the world and its message is clear to all not depending of race ,language we speak or country. It is a real hope for the Romanian cinema as it tries to keep up with the more advanced occidental cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you enjoy watching it as I&#39;m sure that all the people that have seen it liked it and understood it.&#34;

b&#34;An interesting companion piece to true documentaries of John C. Holmes. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t deal with what ultimately killed Holmes, and it certainly could have benefited from doing so. Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg got the most praise for this, but I felt the true stars were Julianne Moore as the cocaine-sniffing mother wannabe, Don Cheadle as a black man struggling with identity as pornstar/stereo-salesman in some wild getups and William H. Macy, who&#39;s wife is the ultimate slut. Not to mention a nearly unrecognizable Alfred Molina. Macy&#39;s new year&#39;s eve bash and Cheadle&#39;s chance for a better life after a donut shop robbery gone wildly wrong are probably the two best scenes in the movie, or at least the two best shot. What this movie does best is show how power can easily corrupt in its various forms. However, none of the characters apparently learn anything from their dark downward spiral as they all rebound and return to their normal lives.&#34;

b&#39;Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye is a great family movie. Salman Khan is looking handsome and great than ever! There\&#39;s even a scene where he takes off his shirt! What a surprise!!! Rani Mukherjee is great too. Pooja Batra had very few lines to say but I\&#39;m glad she has been acknowledged for her role because she definitely has potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s about Prem (Salman Khan) and he is a wedding singer. He is about to marry Nisha (Raveena Tandon) but gets stood up. Prem goes to Nisha\&#39;s house and asks her why he was ditched and it\&#39;s because her brother is ill and she needs to marry an NRI, Rahul (Inder Kumar), to get the money to get him treated. Prem moves on and in comes Priya (Rani Mukherjee). Prem falls in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love with Priya but it\&#39;s a shame she\&#39;s about to get married to an NRI! Who could this NRI be?! Priya falls in love with Prem too while Rahul is there with her. Prem gives Priya an insulting comment one day and she goes off and sets off to Agra for the wedding with Rahul. Will Prem stop her? Watch KPNHJ to find out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film was very funny! The songs were great especially the song &#34;O Priya O Priya&#34; It\&#39;s a shame the film flopped in India and I don\&#39;t know why?! Every film in India is going flop nowadays!! This film deserved to be a hit. The only problem I found with the film is that they had an obsession about NRI\&#39;s! They think ALL NRI\&#39;s are rich! The film deserves a 9/10!&#39;

b&#39;The show itself basically reflects the typical nature of the average youth; partying and picking up chicks is the common weekend goal at the clubs. People frown upon the show due to its &#34;perverted&#34; idea of picking up girls using technique and strategic characterization, but truth be told, practically every young guy is out doing it at the club. Overall, the show really appeals to the younger population, as we like to see the outcome of a &#34;player\&#39;s&#34; performance at the club, as the show offers a comical approach made possible by the judging panel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10; a cool, fun and thrilling series that allows the audience to really interact.

b&#34;TV churns out dozens of true-crime movies every year. You can see 3 or 4 every Saturday on Lifetime, and Court TV can be relied on for a few every weekend. So I started watching The Morrison Murders thinking I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent retelling of a real-life family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautifully acted drama that engrossed me from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the brothers were totally convincing, and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was in almost every frame. If I had any complaint, it was Gordon Clapp as the sheriff. He just doesn&#39;t look or act like a small-town Southern lawman named Byron Calhoun. He looks and sounds like Medavoy, and Medavoy is not right for this part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a minor quibble: The Morrison Murders is well worth watching, and not just on a rainy Saturday afternoon. If you&#39;re going out, tape it. You won&#39;t regret it.&#34;

b&#34;Enchanting. The best time to see this movie is sometime when unhappy or sad. It&#39;s all just so cute, all, even the way that white bear loves the Queen in secret and gets Her in the end, also the achievement the two young actors of Gerda and Kai gave. It&#39;s music is also very nice. The two of us will always be one combined with sad piano tones in some places gives a very touching result and if one watches both parts at once, he&#39;ll see the Snow Queen is not so bad. She only tries to surround Herself with love in the wrong way. The evening this movie was on here (first part) I only watched it, because I was bored, but I loved it a lot more after and was very angry, when they didn&#39;t show the next part because of the Pope&#39;s funeral... Yeah, that was terribly sad for me. But when they said it will be on next week, I was so happy, that I recorded it and now I&#39;m glad to have done so.&#34;

b&#39;I hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem, except to say that it represents young Buster Keaton at the peak of his powers and must certainly rank with the half-dozen best short comedies ever made. THE GOAT is twenty minutes of smoothly paced, expertly photographed, beautifully executed gags; two reels of non-stop comic invention driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending -- which wasn\&#39;t always the way with Buster\&#39;s comedies. (See COPS for one case where Fatalism ultimately got the better of him, or ONE WEEK for the victory of Defeatism.) If I had to describe this film in one word I\&#39;d call it &#34;effortless,&#34; but if I were permitted two I\&#39;d call it &#34;seemingly effortless,&#34; for surely a lot of hard labor goes into the making of any comic opus that unfolds with such sublime ease. Still, they didn\&#39;t call him the Great Stone Face for nothing: Buster never let the public see him sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sardonic title card tells us that our opening sequence is set &#34;along Millionaires\&#39; Row,&#34; i.e. on a bread line in a grim urban setting, where Buster waits patiently at the back of the line and, as a result, doesn\&#39;t get fed. But it needs to be emphasized that not for one moment does he play for pathos; Buster has our sympathy, but he never asks for it. Before long, through a series of accidents, coincidences and absurd misunderstandings, Buster is believed to be an escaped killer named Dead Shot Dan and is being pursued by every cop for miles around, and yet while he\&#39;s clearly dismayed by this turn of events there is never a hint of self-pity or even surprise; we get the sense he always knew that this is what life would have in store for him, and that he hasn\&#39;t time to feel sorry for himself anyway, he has to figure out new ways to dodge those cops and escape from the latest trap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as Buster refrains from playing for sympathy he never seems to strain for laughs either, which is especially impressive because THE GOAT must be one of the most laugh-packed short comedies in existence. This is the film that features that iconic shot of Buster riding a train\&#39;s cow-catcher right up to the very lens of the camera, which isn\&#39;t a gag exactly but sure is laugh-provoking in its own strange way. Meanwhile, there are gags involving guns, dogs, cops, an incredibly furry mustache, and a clay statue of a horse that melts under Buster\&#39;s weight (a surreal sight indeed), but some of the biggest boffos are saved for the finale when Buster is trying to elude his primary nemesis, Big Joe Roberts, a rotund cop who also happens to be the father of leading lady Virginia Fox. Trapped in Big Joe\&#39;s dining room, Buster leap-frogs over him and sails through a transom, turns a phone-booth into an elevator and pretends to disappear, and eventually uses the elevator itself to rid himself of his pursuer and win the girl in time for one last fade-out gag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say more would be a disservice to first-time viewers. I only wish I could see this film in a theater full of people who\&#39;d never seen it before, and float on the laughter. Live musical accompaniment would be nice too; and incidentally the musical score supplied by Kino for their home video/DVD version of THE GOAT is first-rate, serving as icing on an already tasty cake.&#39;

b&#39;Mr. Bean has shaped the face of British TV comedy. He has proved that you do not need wicked words or wit, a massive budget, a great deal of intelligence or even any intelligence to make something brilliant. And Mr. Bean is one of those characters who you just can\&#39;t forget. Some of these episodes had me in stitches - yes, they\&#39;re not realistic at all and they\&#39;re all pretty stupid, but to be honest, realism is one of the barriers Bean has broken on its way to greatness. Rowan Atkinson and co. always manage to cook up interesting new ideas - and hilarious new gags - remember when Mr. Bean drove his green Mini whilst sitting on a sofa on the roof? Mr. Bean is one of those things that never gets weak - the movie wasn\&#39;t as good as this, but Bean has introduced a distinct new sense of humour to the world, and kids and adults alike will marvel at its immense fun factor. &#34;Extras&#34; and &#34;Little Britain&#34; can be damned - this is British comedy at its best and most original. These escapades never get old! 10/10&#39;

b&#34;The first of five St Trinian&#39;s films (although the last is usually discounted) was based around artist Ronald Searle&#39;s schoolgirl characters, and features the wonderful Alastair Sim in drag as Millicent Fritton, headmistress, as well as her own brother. Much of the humour is dated, yet curiously touching and outrageous in today&#39;s PC world - the girls drink, gamble, smoke and are later sold off to rich Arabs, yet always remain in charge, defeating bureaucrats, police, judges and other establishment figures as they maraud across England. Perhaps because the films have been so regularly seen on TV, St Trinians still inspires fancy dress parties and club nights. The films have recurring characters that include PC Ruby Gates (Joyce Grenfell) and Flash Harry (George Cole). The precursor to the entire series is a charming film called &#39;The Happiest Days Of Your Life&#39; (1950).&#34;

b&#39;Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) is wrongfully accused on sabotaging a hanger making aircrafts for the war. He goes on the run, meets Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) along the way, and she joins him to find and bring the real criminals to justice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of things wrong with this film. Robert Cummings was a good actor but he\&#39;s totally miscast in this role; Priscilla Lane is pretty but was never a good actress; the story doesn\&#39;t make a whole lot of sense (and rambles on longer than needed); it wears its patriotism a bit much (but this WAS made while WWII was in full swing) and there\&#39;s no ending. It shouldn\&#39;t work but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s full of bizarre lines and characters that certainly hold your interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example: Lane says to Cummings (while they\&#39;re falling in love), &#34;I wish I could have met you a hundred years ago&#34; (????!!!!); Lane PAYS a villain for getting her lunch and Cummings and Lane join a circus troupe briefly while on the run. Also Hitchcock\&#39;s direction was (as always) just great--he throws in some truly amazing shots and sequences--especially the Statue of Liberty climax. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not one of Hitchcock\&#39;s classic movie but is still very good and worth catching.&#39;

b&#34;This has to be one of the most powerful message-sending movies i saw lately, it was absolutely flawless all the way, amazingly original and thought provoking. Story is unusual and original, and the characters make this story very very powerful. It&#39;s about a guy who kills his ex-girlfriend&#39;s retarded kid brother, and as he is sent to juvenile prison, through many memory flashbacks you get a grip on a story and you don&#39;t let it go until the very end. Murder he commits changes the course of life for every member of his family and the family of deceased, and as you watch and realize that everyone has its own story and its own dark side you just appreciate this movie even more, it&#39;s a total tour de force, cause those actions cannot be described by simple words. His motive of committing murder is left incompletely explained, and it makes viewers think. Acting was pretty much flawless, and the cast was very good, it contains many familiar faces. If you like the movies that are thought provoking and that just make u think during them(e.g. &#39;Donnie Darko&#39;, &#39;Mulholland Dr.&#39;) then &#39;The United States of Leland&#39; is an excellent movie choice for you, otherwise you should pass this movie and watch it when you&#39;re in the mood for serious thought provoking movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10&#34;

b&#34;Jamie Foxx did an incredible job playing Ray Charles. I loved this movie because every so often there would be a flashback scene and then to the current movie. When Ray Charles was little, he went blind and his mother didn&#39;t baby him. She was a strong woman who didn&#39;t treat him any different because he was blind. She made him do things on his own and that really pushed him to become a great musician later on in life. His mother also sent him to school as well. Then when Ray Charles became a man, he could stand up for himself and take care of himself but there was a downfall into narcotics, sex and betrayal. When I am discouraged about something I can just think of this movie and it will inspire me.&#34;

b&#34;This movie is powerful. I watched this movie at 3:00 am and I was suppose to be at work at 6:00 am, needless to say I was late to work. I could not bring myself to get up off my bed to go to work. This is the most powerful movie that I have seen in a long time. And that made me cry and feel the pain of the family. I think Emilo did a wonderful job of directing this film. I agree with the previous comments from other views that this is the only movie that I have seen that has brought the war home and showed what a family had to go through, what a veteran went through. It is almost heart breaking to think that back then people just thought you could come home from a life changing experience and be the same person you were before you left. Kathy Bates reminded me of my mother in a way. I believe she really showed how women felt and acted back then. I am surprised that this film wasn&#39;t up for more awards.&#34;

b&#34;Is this a good movie? No, certainly not. But for Jolie lovers it&#39;s must-have. Her non-polished acting and semi-nudity scene will please her fans for ages to come. The current rating however (3.2) is too low. The movie might lack a good storyline, and isn&#39;t a great sf-movie altogether but the acting is good enough (and like mentioned before, Jolie&#39;s acting is nice and raw), the movie is shot very direct, with a lot of close-ups. The scenery is bizarre. And last but not least, leaving van Damme out was a very good choice. Presumably, non of the Jolie lovers would like to see her having sex with him. This movie has all the potential of becoming a cult movie.&#34;

b&#34;Thirty years prior to THE DEER HUNTER came this movie, an excellent meditation on the effects of war inflicted on the American family as seen from both the war heroes and their wives. A truly ironic title, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES is anything but since those times have vanished into still images and all that is left is an uncertain future for those involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly an ensemble cast despite the top-billing of Myrna Loy, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES focuses more on the stories of the men. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) comes back to a household that has irrevocably changed as his sons have grown although he finds support from his doting wife Milly (Myrna Loy). Fred Derry, upon returning, cannot find a decent job despite being a war veteran and is trapped in a marriage that he does not want to Marie, a happy-go-lucky girl who wants more out of life and who increasingly comes to hate him. Homer Parrish, on the other hand, has greater problems due to his loss of hands at war and feels the entire world -- including the girl he loves and her family -- thinks he is a freak of nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At almost three hours of length, the film never seems long and drawn out. There is so much emotions happening even in small moments that the plot breezes by; nothing seems wasted or placed on screen due to a lack of editing. Not a performance rings false, though the standouts are those of Dana Andrews as Fred Derry, Harold Russell as Homer Parrish and Virginia Mayo as Marie Derry. Even then every character has his or her moment on film, and the time was right to talk about all the pain and suffering that until then had not been seen in American films (including the ones made around World War One, which did not dabble in such topics). While there is never any overt violence, it&#39;s all there, in the haunted expressions of the three male leads&#39; faces, in the lot where the planes now reside, ready to be turned into junk (and therefore, forgetfulness), in the cynicism of the store owners who couldn&#39;t be bothered to employ these shell-shocked men who had seen battle or even worse, to goad them into wondering what was it all worth for. This is the film in which COMING HOME and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY are indebted to. At a time when America fled from war films, to come up with this when the end of the Second World War was still fresh was a necessity in order to make a more honest film-making.&#34;

We may have computer-generated techniques now, but all he had in 1934 was an imagination that wouldn\&#39;t take &#34;no&#34; for an answer. Whatever he wanted to see on the screen, he created. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And he wanted to see some truly bizarre stuff - every imaginable piece of scrap is called up for service: old shoes, chicken bones, utensils, broken glasses, dolls, monkeys, rats....seems like there was nothing that was off limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A truly eerie, even unsettling film that should be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in animation. This film must be seen to be believed!&#39;

b&#34;This if the first movie I&#39;ve given a 10 to in years. If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it. A $4 Mil box is a disgrace. People don&#39;t know what it&#39;s about. If you have any appreciation for the Blues, or just a good use of excellent music, that alone is reason to go see it. How many people knew Jackson could sing, and damn fine too. You hear books and movies taunting that they&#39;re about salvation. After seeing this, you&#39;ll never be able to forgive such trivial use of the word. Yes, it&#39;s gritty, sexy, down home truth, bizarre and in-your-face real. Isn&#39;t that the best reason to see a movie? Those that get my meaning won&#39;t stay away from seeing this another week.&#34;

b&#39;This little film brings back a lot of memories, both fond and foul, of what can and does happen when one is a working musician. The not so pleasant accommodations for the band, the management of the venue jumping up and down telling you what to play, the sheer ecstasy of the applause.............. Far from being farcical it is, in fact, very accurate in the way it depicts musicians, professional and otherwise, who have travelled a great distance to perform a season of gigs at a venue. There are those times when everything goes perfectly, there are those other times when you immediately start to miss your partner and wonder what the hell you are doing this far from home. In the end you have to make the best of it because there is no other way out.&#39;

b&#39;I saw this turkey in the theater, but I had a good time. The special effects aren\&#39;t worthy of a grade school production. A toy boat, representing a freighter, moving at speedboat velocity on flat waters while wind driven fog blows in the opposite direction. The red and blue flood lamps add that extra dramatic touch. Whatever cache Vincent Price was supposed to bring as narrator is completely overshadowed by dreadful production work. Calling this a documentary is like calling Britney Spears a musician. About 20 minutes into this, something struck me as very funny. Maybe it was Price\&#39;s overly dramatic intonation of the oft-used line &#34;They vanished into the Devil\&#39;s Triangle! [cut to black; next story] Once I started laughing, my friends joined in. Next time Vinny said the crucial line, someone in the back yelled out: &#34;Good!&#34; After that, it got almost as many laughs as a Marx Brothers film. Nobody stayed for the dreadfully serious second feature &#34;Chariots of the Gods.&#34;&#39;

b&#34;Unless you want to be bored half to death. I&#39;ve never been a fan of Gus Van Sant and as part of what previous posters have described as the new youth generation i was very disappointed and slightly angry at the stereotypical depiction of the characters in the film especially as they were used to string along the film&#39;s ridiculous storyline which is pretty much enforcing to the viewing masses that skateboarders are social rejects and should be blamed for crimes. As a skater myself i watch a lot of skate films and the filming during the skate scenes, which is obviously a major part of the plot as the lead protagonist is a skateboarder, was awful and Bourne identity esquire shaky camera technique was used with slow motion to give a horrible effect. This film is just full of ridiculous stereotypes as shown by the &#39;emo&#39; soundtrack which just adds to the media myth that all skateboarders are white rockers. Simply just a really bad film.&#34;

b&#39;This is one of those star-filled over-the-top comedies that could a) be hysterical, or b) wish that you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled instead. Unfortunately, One Night at McCool\&#39;s is a classic &#34;b.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goldie Hawn recently commented about &#34;Town and Country&#34; that it\&#39;s a big problem in Hollywood that they start with hiring the actors and putting together a deal before a script is completed. You have to figure that not only did they go into this picture without a complete script, they also mangled it daily. Maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studio that say, &#34;It\&#39;s the script, stupid.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also one of those movies where you find yourself feeling sorry for the actors most of the way through. They\&#39;re working their asses off trying to make all this seem hysterical, but they know most of it is going to be accompanied not by belly laughs but by the sounds of the crickets you can hear inside the silent theatre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it an unmitigated disaster? Not entirely. There are some smiles along the way, mostly due to the efforts of the actors. I probably would have gone out of the theatre thinking, &#34;Eh. It was okay.&#34; So why the undeniably hostile tone in my review? The ending. If, as it\&#39;s been noted, the rest of the movie is just all a setup for the ending, then it misses spectacularly. I really wish I could speak specifically about it, but I hate people who give too much away (even in warning). Suffice it to say that as soon as you see John Goodman behind a bent-over Paul Reiser (nothing given away here. It\&#39;s in the trailer), get the hell out of the theatre and go out thinking, &#34;Eh. It was okay.&#34; The rest of the movie is tacked-on and creatively bankrupt. And you\&#39;ll be appalled that there will actually be people laughing at this mess. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you loved &#34;There\&#39;s Something About Mary&#34; or &#34;Meet The Parents&#34; (both GREAT movies), then don\&#39;t bother to see this movie. Go have those teeth taken care of instead.&#39;

b&#39;Ignore the extreme votes about &#34;House of Wax&#34;, in no way is it either a &#34;1&#34; or a &#34;10&#34;. I will try to be of help to anyone thinking about seeing &#34;House of Wax&#34; or for those who saw it based on the trailer and feel cheated. The trailer makes this movie look very promising, which is what trailers are supposed to do. There is only one thing for sure with trailers, if the producers can\&#39;t cobble together a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer, it is a pretty much a sure thing that the movie is a major suck-fest. But a good trailer only tells you that a few things about the movie are good, it does not give you much idea about the total package. Here a little research can be valuable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;House of Wax&#34; stars Elisha Cuthbert (whose acting skills are closer to Kathy Ireland than to either her fellow Canadian Sarah Polley or her lookalike Rose McGowen), and was directed by a music video artist formerly known as Jaume, in his feature debut. These are not good signs but if you are like me you ignore them and go to see the work of Production Designer Grace Walken, who was responsible for the look of &#34;Ghost Ship&#34;. Once again Walken\&#39;s work is worth seeing, so much so that it looks like 90% of the movie\&#39;s $30 million budget went to production design. The rest went to Cuthbert to compensate her for the abuse she has to take throughout the film (finger cut off, lips glued shut, tied up, and lots of wading around in assorted gooey stuff). By-the-bye, Cuthbert looks considerably heavier than she did in &#34;The Girl Next Door&#34;, about one big pig-out away from having a major weight problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which means they had little left over to pay the rest of the cast and crew. And judging from the what was on the screen, this might actually be true. It looks like everyone else donated their time to get their first acting or crew credit. Unfortunately, whether it was inexperience or jealousy over the pay disparity, the contributions of all these inexperienced/incompetent volunteers amount to less than zero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inexperienced Steven Window\&#39;s DP work was about as awful as you are likely to see and working in league with an incompetent editor like Joel Negran (insert &#34;Pearl Harbor&#34; here) they manage to take away most of the value added by the production design group. Rather than linger over and showcase the sets, Window filmed this stuff with bad lighting and jerky-zooming-bobbing camera work. Negran compounded the problem with an insane number of disorienting cuts. Poor lighting, an ADD-like camera, and flurry cutting are what you use to hide cheap and crappy production design; not what is needed when the movie\&#39;s only strength is its expensive and detailed sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chan Hayes did the screenplay and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as the writer although except for the title and the use of wax figures there is absolutely no similarity. One saving grace is that the movie does not take itself seriously as a horror film and is mostly parody (insert &#34;Van Helsing&#34; here). The murders are played for laughs, too extreme to be scary or even creepy to anyone over age six. The audience particularly cracked up when a certain high profile hotel heiress got her homely face run through by an steel bar, although her earlier half-baked striptease was the only genuinely creepy thing in the film. Another comedy highlight was when Cuthbert sticks her finger through a grate and has it clipped off by the bad guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good scenes take place in Trudy\&#39;s House of Wax, a waxworks that has something to do with a closed sugar mill, conjoined twins, and a lot of roadkill (which Cuthbert gets to bathe in). All this is supposed to be happening somewhere in rural Florida although from the many hills it sure looks like Paul Hogan\&#39;s country (attention location scouts-the gulf coast is not noted for it\&#39;s rolling terrain). The screenplay apparently intended to play up the connection (bad pun) between the two sets of twins, but somewhere during production or post-production most of the dialogue concerning this was trimmed. Since what is left about the twin connection makes no sense and goes nowhere, you wonder why it wasn\&#39;t also cut to reduce the boredom factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is particularly sad is that the producers did not have the brains to recognize in mid-production that they had the ingredients for a first rate horror classic-even with the existing cast. What was staring them in the face was a chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a town of wax. Because it is a photographic medium, modern film is intrinsically naturalistic, almost without exception prone to creating an illusion of reality. Here they had a ready-made opportunity to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization. Like an impressionist painting, the town creates the illusion of reality from a distance but reveals itself as a highly stylized wax fabrication up close. Of course they would have had to find a visionary Director and DP to bring the thing off successfully, but everything else was already in place for this to happen.&#39;

b&#34;Not like I went in expecting a lot out of it, but I was at least hoping for a fun dumb big budget movie. This isn&#39;t even that. This item ranks in the bottom half of all the vampire movies I&#39;ve ever seen (and believe me, I&#39;ve seen a lot of them). Bad acting, zero characterization, little to no thought, almost non-existent plot (and that that&#39;s there you can drive semi-trucks through the holes in). Sure, it has action and is loud, and has more action, and more noise, and blood, and action... These things alone do not make a good (or even halfway decent) movie. Beats me how some people can say this is the best vampire movie ever made--all I can assume is they haven&#39;t seen many. I suggest seeing Near Dark instead.&#34;

b&#39;This film attempts to cash in on the success of Richard Curtis movies, particularly &#34;Love Actually&#34; (which I loved) - a series of disparate scenes following the love lives of various couples. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a great idea poorly executed. The script tries to be a little too clever and simply doesn\&#39;t resonate. Most of the acting is stilted which is more a reflection on the director than the actors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The version I saw (on a plane) was called &#34;Scenes from a Park&#34;, which is a more appropriate title as not all the scenes were of a \&#39;sexual nature\&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so looking forward to this movie, but ultimately it is disappointing.

b&#34;There are a lot of &#39;bad&#39; films out there. Tune in to Channel 5 every night of the week and you might just be treated to a daily, shocking effort from one filmmaker or another. There are possibly films that have caused me more pain - were harder to sit through - than this, but in terms of writing, acting, direction, cinematography and the bare basics of cinema Inbetweeners is a truly, truly appalling effort and should be avoided at all costs. The only laugh it gave me was in the behind the scenes documentary on the DVD, in which the film&#39;s geeky director Darren Fisher explains how it was his script that attracted the &#39;talent&#39; to the project! Never underestimate the power of self-delusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darren Fisher - Britain&#39;s answer to Edward D. Wood Jr.!&#34;

b&#39;An American family moves to the countryside of Spain to live in an isolated house. Regina (Anna Paquin), the teenager daughter of Mark (Iain Glen), who is sick and has some mental problems, and the nurse Maria (Lena Olin), notes that weird things is happening in the house and with her young brother Paul (Stephan Enquist), but her mother does not believe on her. Reggie decides to investigate with her boyfriend Carlos (Fele Mart\xc3\xadnez) the origins of the house, and they find that forty years ago, the place was the stage of the death of six children. Reggie decides to ask for support to her grandfather Albert (Giancarlo Giannini) to protect her brother against the house and her father.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this DVD expecting to see a good horror movie of haunted house mainly because of the names of Anna Paquin, Lena Olin, Fele Mart\xc3\xadnez (from &#34;Thesis&#34; and &#34;Abre los Ojos&#34;) and Giancarlo Giannini. Further, I like very much Spanish cinema. In spite of, I found a terrible screenplay, an awful direction and a deplorable acting of excellent actors and actresses. The intention of the story is good, slightly recalling &#34;The Shinning&#34; in some moments, but unfortunately it is badly developed, never being clear, for example, the reasons and motives why the American family moved to Spain or the horrible relationship between the members of the family, mainly the situation between Maria and Reggie. The direction is confused, poorly trying to use dark and shadows to give scary effects to the story. I love Anna Paquin, but her expressionless face never works in this flick. Lena Olin is a caricature of the great actress she is; and Stephan Enquist is too much weak for such important role. Only Fele Mart\xc3\xadnez has a good performance in his support character. I liked the open end of the story. My vote is four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;A S\xc3\xa9tima V\xc3\xadtima&#34; (&#34;The Seventh Victim&#34;)&#39;

b&#39;Right this moment I am watching this movie on TV here in Tokyo. Beautiful scenery, beautiful sets of biblical proportions, beautiful costumes, beautiful color, beautiful Gina. Great climactic scene when God destroys the Sheban idol and a lot more with de Millean thunderbolts at the moment when Yul and Gina are about to consummate their love. Yul does a halfway decent job of delivering his lines, though he sounds a lot like Yul delivering his lines as Ramses or Taras Bulba. George Sanders sounds like George Sanders playing George Sanders. Given the limited range of acting she is asked to display in this role, Gina does a good job, though by the time the movie ends, she is completely converted into a demure remorseful lass and looks likes she might be playing in a biography of Mother Teresa. I guess thunderbolts will do that to you, but it is almost breathtaking how quickly she jettisons her own beliefs for her new religion. The supporting players are mostly awful, lacking credible emotion and timing. The usual big battle scenes, what passed for lascivious dances in 1959, and an orchestra blasting out plenty of trumpet calls behind a huge chorus singing lots of &#34;Ah\&#39;s&#34;, but none of it quite of topnotch Hollywood quality. The final swordfight between Brynner and Sanders is at the laughingly low skill level of a junior high school play. The film is one big piece of eye candy but not much more.&#39;

b&#39;Another example of the women-in-prison genre. This is not exactly a genre known for quality films, but this is a notch below most. A bunch of women are taken from the bordellos where they work to a prison on a rocky island. Once there, they are subjected to lots of poorly directed sex and atrocious &#34;dialog.&#34; For a film with an astounding amount of sex and nudity there is really nothing erotic about any of it. The sex scenes are awkwardly acted, and some scenes, like the shower scene, seem to drag on and on. That said, there are at least some minimal production values. On the W-i-P scale I would put it above Frauen fur Zellenblock Neun, but below Chained Heat.&#39;

They made the coyotes ferocious looking and this has instilled a fear of coyotes into my daughter. I know coyotes for a fact are not ferocious and are natural predators.

b&#39;Sad in every aspect, this poor excuse for a career boost for Connery was neither that nor the hit Warners wanted it to be. Overlong by 20 minutes and filled with embarrassing moments for everyone involved, this film and &#34;Robocop 2&#34; are proof that Irvin Kershner did not have any real control over &#34;The Empire Strikes Back.&#34; Connery hadn\&#39;t been in a hit since he bowed out from Bond in 1971, but this didn\&#39;t bring him back at all. &#34;Octopussy&#34; was released several months before this film, and easily outgrossed it. Imagine that - a Roger Moore Bond not only better than a simultaneous Connery release, but outgrossing it (and compared to &#34;Never...,&#34; &#34;Octopussy&#34; is on par with &#34;2001.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst Bond theme song, even worse than &#34;The Man with the Golden Gun,&#34; pointless scenes that drag on pointlessly (with the worst example being that ridiculous video game sequence - MY GOD - WHO CARES?!), and the most atrocious collection of non-talent as far as the fabled &#34;Bond Girls&#34; go. Does anybody SERIOUSLY think Kim Basinger is attractive in this movie? There were girls in my high school who could never get dates who looked better than she does in this. And Barbara Carrera - just plain stupid - but the way Kershner has directed her to prance around all the time didn\&#39;t help her out any. She is the seedling that would become the very impressive &#34;Onatop,&#34; which was about the best feature of &#34;GoldenEye,&#34; but that doesn\&#39;t mean anything as you laboriously struggle through this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casting Leiter as a black agent was an excellent idea, but the buddy-loke interaction Connery and he are supposed to have is awfully bad. Two actors never appeared so clumsily linked together - witness the scene where, to escape local authorities, they strip to their boxers and pretend to be out exercising - I can not imagine another scene in any movie that tried so hard so fruitlessly to get a laugh.&#39;

b&#39;Sometimes it is funny to watch films implode from your couch, but other times it is just horribly painful to both your eyes and your mind. House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute is one of those rare examples of when both your eyes and your mind are pleading with you to turn the film off. This final installment to the House Party series is by far the worst, not just sequel, but film released by Hollywood. It becomes very apparent early on in this &#34;feature&#34; that director Chris Stokes loved Ferris Bueller\&#39;s Day Off with a passion. I say this because it becomes very clear that Stokes had no trouble lifting the originality of Bueller off John Hughes\&#39; hands and choosing to create a film completely void of humor. You would think that by &#34;stealing&#34; themes and images from a funnier film, your own film would at least be able to generate a giggle or two. With House Party 4, Stokes proved that he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel, much less a Hollywood film. From his confusing and choppy story, the inability to make sense of his characters, and recycled old/tired clich\xc3\xa9 moments, all Stokes is doing is hitting a bigger nail into the coffin that holds the House Party films. It reminds me of that student that forgets about his project due in an hour and quickly slops together super glue, macaroni, cat hair, chewing gum, and straws and presents it as &#34;Hannibal Crossing the Alps&#34;. It just looks horrible and you feel embarrassed for the creator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, where did this film first take the plunge into the realm of comic stupidity? Honestly, I do not think that most places will allow me to speak that long, so instead I would like to hit upon some of the larger topics that hit me the hardest. To begin, I still cannot shake the Ferris Beuller rip-off. It was as if director Stokes was ashamed of having to direct another sequel to House Party and decided to bring in a completely random formula (from a funnier film) and see if he could cut and paste elements from the original series into that formula. That was a huge mistake. When a director tries to do this, what eventually happens is confusion within the audience. We think that we are going in one direction, but instead we head in another one. That is exactly what you can witness in House Party 4. In one instance we have John-John trying to have the &#34;biggest party of the decade&#34; while also trying to score a record deal (ok, kinda reminds me of the original House Party), but then we whisk away to this random island where Uncle Charles is afraid of flying, Grandma gets drunk, and some idiotic mind-dulling moments with a supposed killer. Again, we begin somewhat strong, and end chaotic. This is the confusion in which I speak. Director Stokes did not have the ability to keep his hand on either the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story. He would rather cut corners, keep the jokes cheap, and think that the audiences are idiots than attempt to revive a stone-dead series. One would think that when a director was handed that task of filming another House Party film he would walk into it thinking that he/she would be the one to revive it or bring it back to life, instead Stokes just wanted to get paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that I am slowly growing older as the days go quickly by, but I do believe I still keep my hand in the younger generation\&#39;s culture. I listened to rap and R&amp;B growing up, but the group &#34;Immature&#34; never made it to either my cassette deck or my CD player. Why? I don\&#39;t think they ever quite had a following, but apparently to director Chris Stokes, it would be beneficial to cast them as leads in his new House Party film. Didn\&#39;t anyone at any studio realize that this was going to be in the red rather quickly? Or how about the option to have Stokes himself play the comedic car repairman, nothing like a director with no sense of comic timing casting himself as the only source of possible humor. It was one of those few instances when I actually missed Robin Harris, and I never thought I would find myself saying that to any film. Outside of a go-nowhere band playing the lead role, I also thought that the remainder of the cast only continued to suck the life out of this film. Uncle Charles was annoying when he attempted humor. Kim Whitely was completely wasted for her scenes (both literally and figuratively) while \xc2\x85 well \xc2\x85 everyone else pretty much falls into that category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where did Chris Stokes spend most of the budget for this film? Not for special guest stars because while this film may have boasted some, there were definitely none present at the &#34;unforgettable&#34; House Party, nor the possible dream that perhaps Kid or Play would make one final appearance. House Party 4 followed no preset design, which ultimately ruined this feature from the foundation down. Can anyone explain to me why there was any need to use the &#34;escaped murderer who happened to be a licensed taxicab driver&#34; routine for humor? Stokes was reaching deep within the bottom of the barrel and only produced more muck instead of substance. For once I can admit to there being no redeeming value to this film. House Party 4 buried the series, and while I do hear that there may be more in the pipeline, I only hope Hollywood realizes that this series has died. Hollywood needs to let this series end, forget about the past and move forward in the future. I think a sequel to Who\&#39;s the Man? would get them started in the right direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: * out of *****&#39;

b&#39;The only reason I bought the DVD was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene when Liz (Kim Basinger) strips to the music of Joe Cocker: You Can Leave Your Hat On! That was the best part of the whole film. Not because the scene was any good; only the song. I am not saying it was a terribly bad film just not that good. Disappointingly so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially when the exploration of male and female sexuality could have been expanded upon. Instead of expanding on the dangerous side of lust, obsession and infatuation and where it can lead to it drags its heels obscurely from one idea to the other. For example when John (played by Rourke) is able to leave her on the top of the Big Wheel, Liz (Kim Basinger) is unconvincingly rattled at the bizarre experience courtesy of John\&#39;s sense of humor but less rattled at his sexual exploits involving the ever willing Liz; and like one reader mentioned, that for a woman to enjoy sex she has to experience the dangerous side is unconvincing. This &#34;dangerous&#34; side is not exploited enough in the film and one gets a sense of anti-climax from the view point that it all could go horribly wrong. The theme of bondage makes an appearance often but only just takes one to the brink of danger and then all goes well.Is the film sending the message out that this kind of &#34;foreplay&#34; is FINE! If the film was making a point about the pitfalls of bondage and by extension the ugly ramifications of sad-masochism then maybe it would make a good moral point. Instead the film awkwardly jumps from one &#34;sizzling&#34; scene of Rourke feeding Basinger and blindfolding her to another. In a film that could have been good it falls flat on its face because it does not expand and extend the themes the film is MAYBE trying to relate; thus for me it doesn\&#39;t have a plot nor a theme just a mixture of ideas.&#39;

b&#39;i wrote an essay in 1981, the year i graduated high school called the &#34;last American virgin.&#34; i also had a friend named nancy who was the prostitute in this film. apparently her daughter got a hold of my essay one night when she slept over my house. a year later i wake up one morning and see the advertisement for this film. i was 18 years old &amp; based the essay on experiences in my life. the film is a bit different from my essay but definitely taken from it. i did not have any proof of this matter except my English teacher mr.Versace who gave me an A on my essay.i let it go &amp; never did anything about it.i figured what comes around goes around.i still would not take any action against anyone involved in this film. i just needed to get it off my chest, as i really never told anyone about it, except my closest friend &amp; they agreed to keep it a secret.the same year it came out i saw nancy in a market, she actually had the nerve to ask me if i had any good stories or scripts for her to look at. i guess thats what Hollywood is all about, getting stories from wherever you can.it was interesting seeing parts of my life on the big screen though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ghost writer!&#39;

b&#34;Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey, T\xc3\xa9a Leoni) wind up on the unemployment line when the corporation Dick works for is caught in a corruption scandal, and after desperately and unsuccessfully trying to find jobs, the duo turns to crime in order to get them out of poverty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve always been a fan of Jim Carrey. It&#39;s been awhile since he has made a straight up comedy. The last one was Bruce Almighty which was pretty good. He has proved that he can do serious dramas but comedy is his real element. Fun with Dick and Jane proves that he still has it. Even though the film was funny, it was still kind of disappointing. It wasn&#39;t as funny as I thought it would be. It&#39;s worth watching once though unlike most of Carrey&#39;s movies, it doesn&#39;t have a good repeat value. Part of the problem is the script. I was surprised the script was weak since this is the same guy that made The Forty Year Old Virgin. Some of the jokes just fall flat and other times they seem to be trying too hard. If Jim Carrey wasn&#39;t in it, than the film would have been a lot worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next to Jim Carrey is T\xc3\xa9a Leoni. She&#39;s an okay actress but she just isn&#39;t very funny. She doesn&#39;t match up well with Carrey and she seemed to be phoning in her performance. They should have gone with someone else. The supporting cast includes Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins and Aaron Michael Jenkins. The latter plays Billy Harper and he actually gives a decent performance. He wasn&#39;t as annoying as most child stars are. Alec Baldwin was okay and Richard Jenkins tried too hard to be funny. To be honest, I&#39;m a little bias here. The film altogether was pretty average but I liked it more because of Jim Carrey&#39;s performance. Fans of Jim Carrey should enjoy it but that&#39;s about it. In the end, Fun with Dick and Jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes but its not very memorable. Rating 6/10&#34;

b&#39;Wow - Thank god I was on an airplane and could look out the window. Bad Hollywood fire scenes, predictable, terribly acted (who the hell was that awful woman who played the wife?), badly casted, awfully written. This movie was apparently made to appeal to the type of person who\&#39;s willing to kneel at the alter of either firemen specifically, &#34;Heroes&#34; or gods in general, I suppose. I just don\&#39;t have enough bad things to say about this film. It couldn\&#39;t have been cheap, either, with all the stars that were in it plus all those special effects and fire scenes. Had to have cost a fortune, yet it still sucked worse than any movie I can even remember seeing. Funeral scene? Astonishingly bad. Courtship between fireman and aforementioned awful woman? Corny, contrived, trite. Firehouse pranks? Don\&#39;t we all wish we could be both so manly and churlish at the same time.&#39;

b&#39;Seriously disappointing performance by Brad Pitt and Q T, the plot is very superficial and lame, and, unless indirectly intended, this film actually glorify the Nazis and portrays them as men of honor, and show that the Jewish people are deceiving, cant keep promises and bloody vicious. ((THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILER)) Hitler together with the most notorious Nazis are attending a stupid plot less movie about the killing of 300 Italian soldiers in a small cinema theater in Paris is unbelievably ridiculous. the Nazis laughing and hooraying each killing in the movie as if watching a basketball game STUPID, the deal at the end is lame. whats really appalling is that the movie earned great reviews and is ranked here in the 40s amongst the greatest 250 films. will not be surprised if it harvested many awards, including Oscars, as well. the movie is simply a kissing ass to the Jewish people, but hey reconsider, its not even doing a great job doing that. it truly dwarfed the whole Nazi - Jews conflict and a pure insult to all who fought and suffered from the tyranny of the Nazis.&#39;

b&#34;It pains me to say this about an Australian film but Mr. Accident ranks with the worst of the worst films I have ever seen. What&#39;s even more tragic is that it doesn&#39;t fit into the &#39;it&#39;s so bad it&#39;s good&#39; category. What annoys me the most about this film is the fairly large amount of money that has been frittered away on a pointless, unfunny, underdeveloped, inept screenplay. Dumb performances (What are Garry McDonald and Elisabeth Gore aka Elle McFeast doing in this trash?), inadequate direction, no plot and a general sense of meanness totally take away from the interesting production design and leave you with a truly horrible taste in your mouth. Comedy! Ha! Do yourself a favour and stay away!&#34;

b&#34;There is nothing mean spirited or evil about this movie. It&#39;s just terribly dull. Dull is the photography--- the film stock appears old and faded and washed-out. Maybe it was even 16mm blown up to 35mm, dunno. Dull is the script, which is tedious and &#39;Jules Pfeiffer&#39;-ish. That is, kind of 1960s bossa-nova cocktail party cool. Like our beatnik grandparents might have spoken if they were trying to appear really straight. The &#39;slice-of-life&#39; characters were mostly annoying. True, they were real to life, but hey, if I wanted to see truly ordinary people doing really mundane and ordinary things, I&#39;d just watch myself. I wouldn&#39;t trapse all the way down to a cinema and blow five quid, and an evening, watching someone else do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected a funny, bright rom-com. What I got was more like what two intelligent and moderately talented 19 or 20 year-olds might have produced on their first day with a new video camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this a 4 out 10, because it appears that someone tried, at least.&#34;

b&#39;There are certain horror directors for whom I\&#39;ve built up so much respect &amp; admiration over the years, that they can\&#39;t possibly disappoint me know matter what garbage to decide to put on film. Lucio Fulci is surely one of them, but damned, he\&#39;s trying to disappoint me with his later efforts! You can easily afford yourself to skip most of the films Fulci directed or produced during the late 80\&#39;s and simply watch &#34;Cat in the Brain&#34; instead, because that one title gathers and repeats the best and absolute goriest footage of no less than SEVEN other Fulci-flicks, including the sickest murders sequences featuring in &#34;When Alice Broke the Mirror&#34;. As a whole, this movie definitely ranks among our director\&#39;s weakest and most pointless achievements. The script is incoherent as hell, the basic premise is totally implausible and somewhat stupid and there\&#39;s absolutely no suspense to enjoy. I love the title, but it\&#39;s actually quite meaningless. There is a character named Alice in the story, but it\&#39;s only a supportive role and she certainly doesn\&#39;t break any mirrors. I suppose she could break stuff simply using her voice, as she\&#39;s an opera singer, but she doesn\&#39;t. The plot revolves on a middle-aged and gambling-addicted playboy who spends his days seducing wealthy widows and killing them for their money. Lester Parson butchers the ladies (as well as unwelcome witnesses) in gruesome ways, makes steaks out of their juiciest body parts and feeds the remainders to his cat. There\&#39;s also a silly psychological sub plot in which he thinks his own shadow is responsible for the murders instead of him. The difference between &#34;When Alice Broke the Mirror&#34; and some of Fulci\&#39;s greatest horror films (&#34;The Beyond&#34;, &#34;City of the Living Dead&#34;, \xc2\x85&#34;) lies in the fact that he totally doesn\&#39;t bother to create a horrific atmosphere. The characters, Lester included, are colorless and boring and the murders are ordinarily depicted; like it\&#39;s the most common thing in the world to put a woman\&#39;s head in a microwave or repeatedly run back and forth over a human body with a car. The lighting is poor, the cinematography super-ugly, the editing clumsy and amateurish and the acting performances are downright miserable. If I didn\&#39;t know any better, I would think Lucio deliberately made a lousy film in order to protest against all the harsh critics that dislike his repertoire no matter how much spirit and effort he put into it. The obvious element to enjoy here is simply the outrageous gore &amp; bloodshed, because even the attempt to blend in black comedy doesn\&#39;t work properly. As long as Lester swings around his chainsaw and cuts off women\&#39;s feet, &#34;When Alice Broke the Mirror&#34; is an undemanding piece of horror entertainment, but other than that, there\&#39;s isn\&#39;t a whole lot to recommend.&#39;

b&#39;This movie endorses self-justice! It grants freedom to a black man who killed the men who raped his daughter and in the end he gets of scat-free! Despicable enough as this may be, there is also adultery in this film. The Connaughey character has the hots for the Bullock character and the film has some of those stereotypes of trial films (like the important news brought to the court in the nick of time)that make every aesthetically demanding film-goer such as me sick! I really cannot believe that someone liked this junk. It is a film so bad and holding up false ideals that I am unable to put my critic in an eloquently pleasing way. When will the American people wake up and find out that they are being manipulated 24/7 by films like these that turn reality into some BS where there is justice for all if only they take it into their hands. This cowboy attitude just makes me sick and in my eyes it represents everything that is wrong with America!&#39;

b&#39;I have seen this movie several times, it sure is one of the cheapest action flicks of the eighties. So, I think many viewers would definitely change the channel when they come across this one. But, if you are into great trash, &#34;Dragon Hunt&#34; is made for you. The main characters (the McNamara Twins) are sporting great moustaches and look so ridiculous in their camouflage dresses. One of the best scenes is when one of then gets shot in the leg and is still kicking his enemies into nirvana. This movie is really awful, but then again, it is a great party tape!&#39;

b&#34;Wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie truly is. I usually pride myself on being able to enjoy any movie no matter how bad, but this was just too much. I would only suggest watching this movie as a torture device. If you can get past the terrible plot and dialogue by watching it on mute, the even more terrible camera work and shoddy special effects make this movie a real horror. If your thinking about watching this because your a Sandra Bullock fan, don&#39;t even bother as she has less than ten minutes of screen time, and her acting is absolutely atrocious. Not to mention the rest of the cast, which could be replaced with baboons who would do a better job, at least then we wouldn&#39;t have to listen to the terrible dialogue.&#34;

b&#39;1960\&#39;s kid show with ex-vaudevillians playing handy men for hire. As you can expect they are a disaster at everything they do. Over the course of the 11 minute episodes (leaving 4 minutes for commercials in the 15 minute time slot), they do things like set up a fence between warring neighbors, help a magician on stage and deal with a found trunk and wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up I had never run across this show (which appears to have been shot in New York). I thought I had run heard of or seen a most of the children\&#39;s shows from the period either through having watched them as a kid or viewed them at nostalgia conventions. Until Alpha Video released it on DVD I had been completely unaware if its existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show plays like the Three Stooges mixed with Abbott and Costello as done by people aping the routines. (Indeed one of the pair claims to have created the legendary &#34;Slowly I turned...&#34; routine that Abbott and Costello perfected). Its not bad, but its really not good either since everything seems watered down. The timing is often off (Though that maybe due to bad direction) and the jokes were recycled years before the show first ran. Odds are you\&#39;ve seen it all before . On the plus side its the type of thing that would be perfect to introduce very young kids to the magic of vaudeville style comedy, however its going to be trying for parents to sit through even with the short episodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nostalgia junkies only. Everyone else should look to seeing an Abbott and Costello or Three Stooges original.&#39;

b&#34;Committed doom and gloomer Peter Watkins goes slummin&#39; across the pond to take on the American justice system circa 1971 with this priceless piece of zeitgeist paranoia that leans so far left it falls over constantly. Watkins is pure tourist as he assembles this our gang tragedy with clich\xc3\xa9 freaks, hippies and black revolutionaries pitted against trigger happy cops and military and a kangaroo court tribunal made up of disapproving calcified adults making poor fashion statements. Talk about a revolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Punishment Park we have radical youth versus corrupt system as dissenters convicted of crimes are given the choice of imprisonment or a three day trek across Punishment Park (Death Valley) and freedom. Of course the law enforcement officials monitoring their journey aren&#39;t about to play fair and combined with the stifling heat the fate of our protagonists looks sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Punishment Park has elements of Kafka in setting as well as theme. Trials are held under a large canvas tent where shackled prisoners shout defiance at a hardcore love it or leave it group of inquisitors (such as members of Silent Majority for a Peaceful America) who snarl back. Neither group spends much time listening to the other and the proceedings sometime takes on a teen parent battle over the keys to the car look. Mostly its just one side saying what&#39;s wrong with America the other saying what&#39;s right with no one offering solutions for change. Meanwhile the Punishment Park martyrs stumble endlessly about the dessert while cops with guns act like twelve year olds. It kind of has the look and feel of some of my 70&#39;s college film making class when we were younger and knew more then than we do now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter Watkins has always been on the side of the underdog and the common man against what he perceives as a corrupt powerful few. Culledon was a strong indictment of military atrocity in 18th century Scotland that still resonates. War Game is a raw sobering look at nuclear aftermath that should be required viewing for all. Punishment Park has its value as well but for other than intended reason. Watkins vision today is a textbook example of the left in full tilt counter culture 70s paranoia and given the times ( Vietnam, Kent State, The Chicago 7) such strident hysteria seemed not that great a distance from the truth. But 35 years later the fever has subsided and Punishment Park with it&#39;s unrestrained narrow viewpoint is a pretty silly ride.&#34;

b&#39;20th Century Fox\&#39;s ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie. Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more. Miscast is Ida Lupino in the leading role! Lupino, a lady who was capable of exuding about as much sex appeal as a blood orange, is here under the illusion she is Rita Hayworth playing the part of a sexy bar-room Torch Singer. Handsome Cornel Wilde as her lover is as wooden as usual and totally wasted is the talented Celeste Holm who\&#39;s role is little more than a bit part. Then we have Richard Widmark who has the most ludicrously written part in the picture! When we first see him he is a nice O.K. guy who runs a thriving Road House. Then suddenly - and for reasons that are not sufficiently made clear - he becomes insanely jealous of his manager (Wilde) when the latter tells him that he is about to marry Lupino. You see Widmark wanted to marry her himself but - 1) He never proposed to her - 2) They never had a relationship (they don\&#39;t even have anything that resembles a love scene together) and - 3)without telling anyone (including Lupino) he has obtained a marriage license. Wow! So how Widmark was to achieve something like wedded bliss with Lupino after such a &#34;courtship&#34; is anybody\&#39;s quess. Huh? Well, when Widmark goes to pieces over the whole affair so also does the movie I am sorry to say. From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical! His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing. He finally goes over the edge, becomes completely deranged and with a few Tommy Udo sniggers, he laughably goes gunning for poor Cornel Wilde before biting the dust himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if that isn\&#39;t enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors. There\&#39;s not a single outdoor shot in the entire movie! Added to this - 95% of the film takes place at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides an interactive press book and a photo gallery the extras also includes a featurette &#34;Widmark &amp; Lupino At Fox&#34;. Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me! As far as I know they were never before together in a movie at Fox or anywhere else! However this featurette is hosted by such heavy hitter know-alls as Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belhmer and a few others who amazingly heap praise on this wearisome and cringe - inducing affair. All I can say then it must be me I guess. But &#34;Road House&#34; up to now was a forgotten and buried Noir and as far as I am concerned it should have remained so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fox would do better if they issued DVDs of superior and thus far elusive Widmark movies like &#34;Down To The Sea In Ships&#34; (1949) and the colourful &#34;Red Skies Of Montana&#34; (1952).&#39;

b&#39;The monster will look very familiar to you. So will the rest of the film, if you\&#39;ve seen a half-dozen of these teenagers-trapped-in-the-woods movies. Okay, so they\&#39;re not teenagers, this time, but they may as well be. Three couples decide it might be a good idea to check out a nearly-abandoned ghost town, in hopes of finding the gold that people were killed over a scant century-and-a-half before. You\&#39;d think that with a title like &#34;Miner\&#39;s Massacre&#34; some interesting things might happen. They don\&#39;t. In fact, only about 1/10 of the film actually takes place in the mine. I had envisioned teams of terrified miners scampering for their lives in the cavernous confines of their workplace, praying that Black Lung Disease would get them before The Grim Reaper exacted his grisly revenge, but instead I got terrestrial twenty-somethings fornicating--and, in one case, defecating--in the woods, a gang of morons with a collective I.Q. that would have difficulty pulling a plastic ring out of a box of Cracker Jacks, much less a buried treasure from an abandoned mine. No suspense, no scares, and plenty of embarrassing performances give this turkey a 3 for nudity.&#39;

b&#39;Wow, I swear this has never happened to me before\xc2\x85. I only watched &#34;Golden Temple Amazons&#34; yesterday and already I haven\&#39;t got the slightest recollection of anything that happened in this film. That\&#39;s how brilliant this movie is, I guess! By now I only remember being lured into watching it because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover art, showing a torrid drawing of a voluptuous Amazon preparing her bow to fire at an unspecified target. I often get fooled by appealing DVD covers \xc2\x96 especially Jess Franco ones \xc2\x96 and I still haven\&#39;t learned to resist even after literally hundreds of awful experiences. Oh well\xc2\x85 After reading the other user-comments, some parts of my memory returned although I still suspect to confuse this film with another Jess Franco masterpiece I watched the day before, namely &#34;Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro&#34; (and, yes, that one had an awesome DVD cover as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Golden Temple Amazons&#34; opens with a posse of hot white African Amazons \xc2\x96 I am aware of the contradiction but don\&#39;t blame me \xc2\x96 slaughtering the parents of a fragile young girl because they were trespassing the turf with the intention of stealing the golden treasures from the temple. Several years and hormonal changes later, the girl returns to the jungle to get her revenge. She\&#39;s accompanied by a bunch of sleazy adventurers who are less interested in the act of vengeance but wouldn\&#39;t mind taking some gold back home. The rudimentary premise is obviously secondary to all the showcasing of ravishing female nudity and gratuitous sleaze. Anal\xc3\xada Ivars, Eva L\xc3\xa9on and the other nameless Amazons are all regular Franco choices and willingly walk around with their breasts proudly exposed. You better enjoy gazing at all these perfect female curves, as the rest of &#34;Golden Temple Amazons&#34; is a boring and incompetent mess. There\&#39;s hardly any violence or action and no less than half of the film is pure filler, bits and pieces of National Geographic documentaries edited into the story and that sort of stuff. The awesome DVD cover would definitely be a great addition to your collection, but opening the box is utter pointless.&#39;

It was simply these two guys doing their Amos and Andy/Stepin\&#39; Fetchit impressions. Offensive to blacks? Of course, but that\&#39;s the 1930s for you. Some of their lines were funny, some were stupid. The main fault I had with this cartoon was the audio, as it was often not easy to understand what these two guys were saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, a curiosity piece, but don\&#39;t let the racism stop you from checking it out.

b&#39;Even though i sat and watched the whole thing,i must say it was not good.it was all over the place,with big chunks of information missing about how things developed and even inaccurate at some bits too.If you know nothing about Michael , you wont understand a thing.You have to rely on your current knowledge of the man in order for some bits to make sense..Acting was a bit dramatic, Flex Alexander looked nothing like Michael which was a put off for me and towards the end he literally looked grey.saying that portraying Michael as somewhat naive but highly positive, gentle and loving individual was okay even though they still made a fool out of him time to time.If you want to watch MJ\&#39;s life story check out &#34;An American dream&#34;. It is much better but the only thing is it will cover up to &#34;Bad&#34; era. I have no doubt that they will eventually make a big budget movie of MJ\&#39;s life story, cos Michael You rock ;-) !!!!&#39;

b&#39;A SOUND OF THUNDER. One of the greatest short stories ever written. By one of the grandest Grand Masters of Fantasy, Ray Bradbury. What a great story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what a vomitous movie! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Bradbury\&#39;s science fiction short story, a company called Time Safari offers big game hunters the opportunity to go back in time and kill dinosaurs. Rule Number One is: Stay On The Path, a floating metallic walkway that ensures no interaction with the prehistoric environment. During a hunt, a man steps off the path and inadvertently crushes a butterfly. When the hunting party returns to the present - the world as they know it has drastically changed. Though there are paradoxes in any time travel story, Bradbury\&#39;s tale was a quick jugular stroke, a parable of the ripple effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Sound of Thunder was published in 1952 (according to Wikipedia, the most republished science fiction story of all time), and illustrated Chaos Theory, Darwinism, and The Butterfly Effect (which would only be coined in the 1960s by Edward Lorenz). In Bradbury\&#39;s story, the wonder of time travel was overshadowed by corporate greed, in turn overshadowed by the mortal danger to humanity\&#39;s existence itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While in the movie, A SOUND OF THUNDER (directed by the uneven Peter Hyams, CAPRICORN ONE, 2010: ODYSSEY TWO), a clutch of bad actors goes through the time portal again and again to try to rectify their mistakes, like an excrement version of BACK TO THE FUTURE. The movie has nothing to do with Bradbury\&#39;s powerful tale, except the initial jolt of the time traveling prehistoric hunting party. Egregious liberties are taken with Bradbury\&#39;s story - baboon-faced reptiles, plants overrunning Chicago\&#39;s concrete, time waves rippling through the city, CGI insectoids - for which Bradbury should sue the pants and underpants and ass-hairs off the filmmakers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Novice writers Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer and Gregory Poirier should start a Big Balls Agency, for thinking they could actually add elements to a Ray Bradbury story that would improve it. How do these guys walk in a straight line with balls this big? Ben Kingsley is the corporate owner of Time Safari, with a hairpiece so bad it looks like a hairpiece, Edward Burns is his lead hunter, Travis, and Catherine McCormack (who was Murron MacClannough, in BRAVEHEART) is the scientist with the best breasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can\&#39;t possibly relate the hundreds upon thousands of egregious stupidities and asinine pieces of dialog, but here is just one, spoken by David Oyelowo as some kind of &#34;scientist&#34;: he refers to the Pleiades star cluster, &#34;The Seven Sisters, they look like stars, don\&#39;t they? But each of them is a whole galaxy.&#34; Uh, no, idiot scientist, they\&#39;re actually, uh, stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those three morons who rewrote Bradbury\&#39;s story forgot they didn\&#39;t know anything about physics or astronomy. Or writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part of the movie is Catherine McCormick\&#39;s chest straining against her disheveled one-size-too-small blouses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy\&#39;s Movie Mania).&#39;

b&#39;&#34;Bar Hopping&#34; seems to be trying to be about the stereotypical bar tender and lay &#34;shrink&#34; serving up pearls of wisdom followed by example vignettes played out by the cast. However, this turkey is a jumbled mess with a script full of simple-minded cliched nonsense: Hard to follow, herky-jerky flow, unsatisfying, and not worth the time. (D)&#39;

b&#39;Although this movie is inaccurate overall, there are some items that may be true. Certainly, he was a wild character in his youth, having played practical jokes on his fellow cadets at West Point, almost expelled several times, graduating last in his class (of 34), and often reckless in his leadership during the Civil War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But history may have made him a scape goat of the Indian Wars. Certainly, he did his share of cruel things, but how much was he under orders? Also, there is evidence that he testified before Congress (at great risk to his commission and command) that he argued about the fairness of breaking treaties with the Indians and that if he was an Indian he would also fight rather than live on a reservation! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a character said in the play 1776 when asked what will be said about the British about losing the Revolutionary War, the character states &#34;history will do what it always does...it will lie.&#34; Who knows how bad a man Custer was. Certainly he wasn\&#39;t the sympathetic character as portrayed by Errol Flynn and later by Ronald Reagan. But I also doubt he was completely evil as he is later portrayed.&#39;

b&#39;Good lord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m going to say right off the bat, I only watched 20 minutes of this movie. As I am a hardcore Eraserhead fan, the &#34;what, you can\&#39;t watch a wierd black and white movie with little-to-no dialogue?&#34; defense does not apply. I simply can\&#39;t watch TERRIBLE weird black and white movies with little-to-no dialogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is what happens when you give an angsty goth-child with no talent and nothing to say a camera and budget, and let him/her put as much meaninglessly offensive imagery on screen as possible. It was clear from the start that this film should have been 5 minutes long (assuming it should exist at all). Shots that should last a few seconds drag on for minutes, because the director has &#34;I-Just-Love-The-Sound-Of-My-Own-Voice&#34; syndrome, and refuses to cut to another shot until the entire piece of footage has been viewed. From the moment the girl in the mask started masturbating the corpse of &#34;God&#34; (the opening scene of the film! joy!), I knew it was only a matter of time until I turned off the tape. After at least 10 minutes of a different corpse being pulled around, twitching, on a rope, by a gang of cloaked mystery-men, I knew it was time to give up. Rarely do I give up on a movie. I sat through the entirety of Blair Witch 2: Book Of Shadows, albeit not happily. This did not deserve the 20 minutes I gave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you\&#39;re an Eraserhead fan, do NOT let simple-minded comparisons to said film con you into renting this piece of amateur trash. Allow me to refer you to Tetsuo: The Iron Man, for a watchable and enjoyable piece of incoherent black and white weirdness.&#39;

b&#39;My kids enjoyed the movie, but I was bored. There were a few good lines and a handful of funny parts, but the plot was pretty lame and relied on the special effects and gadgets to pull it through. Still, it hit the center of the bullseye that it was aiming for: it was good for the kids.&#39;

b&#34;This movie just seemed to lack direction. The plot developed so many twists in such a short amount of time that it seemed to lose any semblance of what the true storyline was. There was a lot of wasted dialogue and just seemed like the writing was rushed and a little too wandering. The exorcism scenes and possession story began to take a back seat to the character&#39;s back stories (which were a little weak to begin with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would say skip it unless you have rented out the rest of the horror section at your local video store and you have a jones for a movie you haven&#39;t seen before. You&#39;re much better off just watching The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose.&#34;

b&#34;The Nun is a revenge picture whereby a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer trash charges and comes back years later to get even when the now adults visit their old school. Story line is predictable in spades and will hold no surprises as it slowly winds its way to the end. It is a screamer of a movie with passable acting and a below average script and screenplay. Much of the special effects are low grade and there is almost zero believability in the final battle. Still, if you look past these there is some suspense and acting jewels. If you like senseless cookie cutter screamers, you&#39;ll like this, otherwise you should pass.&#34;

b&#39;Ken Harrison, a young sculptor in his early thirties, is seriously injured in a road accident. End of story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;End of story&#34;, that is, in the sense of &#34;end of any physical action&#34;. Not in the sense of &#34;end of the film&#34;. Ken\&#39;s life is saved, but he is paralysed from the neck down. When he discovers that he is unlikely ever to regain the use of his limbs he decides that he wants to die and asks the doctors to end the medical treatment which is keeping him alive. The rest of the film is essentially one long debate about the rights and wrongs of euthanasia and the right to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ken\&#39;s main antagonist in this debate is his doctor, Michael Emerson. Although the case against euthanasia is often presented in religious terms, here it is presented in purely secular ones. If Dr Emerson has any deep religious convictions, these are never expressed in the film. He believes passionately, however, that death is an enemy against which it is his duty as a doctor to fight; to allow a patient effectively to take his own life would represent a surrender to that enemy and a dereliction of that duty. Ken therefore finds himself in a &#34;Catch-22&#34; situation. He must be able to show that he is sane and rational enough to make the decision to end his life. Emerson, however, considers that a wish to die is in itself evidence of insanity and irrationality. Ken\&#39;s dilemma can only be solved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Dreyfuss as Ken and John Cassavetes as Dr Emerson put across their respective points of view skilfully and with sincerity, but this cannot hide the fact that &#34;Whose Life is it Anyway?&#34; simply does not work as a film. At one time filmed versions of stage plays were done in a similar way to theatrical productions but by the seventies and eighties this was often seen as unsatisfactory because of the differences between the two media. When plays were filmed, therefore, the general tendency was to &#34;open them up&#34; by filming on location as well as on studio sets, by taking liberties with the playwright\&#39;s text, often making significant changes to the plot and even introducing extra characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never seen Brian Clarke\&#39;s play, but I suspect that this is a story that would work better in the theatre than in the cinema. There is very little physical action; most of the action consists of lengthy discussions around a hospital bed in which the main character lies paralysed. Such a plot does not lend itself to the &#34;opening up&#34; device at all, and the resulting film is very static, dominated by talk at the expense of action. Although it is well written and there is some good acting, I am surprised that a film was ever made of such an uncinematic subject. 4/10&#39;

b&#39;I felt compelled to write about this movie after i joined IMDb because i thought it was the worst script writing i have seen in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting/direction/other-areas of the movie are fantastic. I love brad Pitt with George Clooney. It works. The witty banter was still there too from the first movie. My question is how in the world did they let this script out of the drafting process? I thought that not only did the plot develop like a slug racing to the end of the sidewalk, but that twist? (can i call it that) was so incredibly stupid that i wanted to go demand a refund from the ticket booth. I have never felt so played and used from a movie in my entire life. Here i was expecting something similar to the first movie (good chemistry, good acting, good direction, amazing plot) only to find that they had taking my 8 dollars and made a mockery out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part that gets me still is that this movie has now grossed more than 125 million dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I felt that this movie insulted my intelligence. I still feel like the only part the writers concentrated on was that little bit with Julia Roberts acting like Julia Roberts. This movie made me sad and angry.&#39;

b&#39;This French film is supposedly about a creepy, dim-witted cop who investigates the rape and murder of a young girl in a small town. However, the film is really about nothing and it takes forever to say nothing. If it takes a character ten minutes to walk from Point A to Point B, the film spends ten minutes showing this walk, and these are the &#34;action&#34; scenes. There are also static shots that last for minutes, making the viewer wonder if he accidentally hit the pause button on the remote. The script has enough material for a 20-minute movie. The movie lasts seven hours or so. You do the math. The actors were apparently amateurs and it shows. Note to self: never see a Dumont movie again.&#39;

b&#39;This film is the proof that a good actor is nothing without a good direction. Ed Harris is awful. How could you cast an actor built like Rambo to play the &#34;Maestro&#34;? He shows no credibility at all and overplays Beethoven. Most of all, long hairs doesn\&#39;t look good at all on his head. The main actress is missing all the subtleties needed for its character. The camera shots are cheesy and too conventional. The lights are to close of the characters feelings. Bad casting and cheap direction. Too bad! The only scene that worth the movie is when Beeth (I hope you don\&#39;t care that I call him trough his nickname?) is turning the girl\&#39;s song to a joke. Any way, I hope that Harris could find his way back to true movie where he can really shows his hairless talent.&#39;

b&#34;Seriously, I couldn&#39;t find anything that constituted a rational human thought in this movie. For some reason, the writer decided to have a bunch of actors in random places grunting, groveling and yelling like Cro-Magnon bipeds. I understand that this was about gymnastics, but seriously, what&#39;s with all the roaring and human bleating ? I also saw at least five actors with overactive terrets syndrome and stage 10 syphilis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this movie has actual human acrobatics, I must say it is surprising that you can make a movie like this without having any intelligible form of human speech patterns. This is truly a milestone in the history of film-making because there was no conscious decision to make the characters express anything more than a timely Urrrrr ! or Rfff ! sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incredible.&#34;

b&#39;The fifth collaboration between Marlene Dietrich and director Josef von Sternberg, BLONDE VENUS is a film that looks great while it\&#39;s playing but fails to engages the viewer. The plodding storyline of Dietrich being torn between two men, becoming a mammoth cabaret star, and fighting for the custody of her child is jumbled and often feels like bits of three separate films half-baked together. Dietrich is unwisely cast in a rather passive, reactive role for much of the film and her character remains aloof from viewers, while Herbert Marshal is unconvincing as her ill-tempered husband, and Cary Grant is largely wasted as a suave suitor who dashes in and out of the picture. The film does contain some intriguing set pieces (the &#34;Hot Voodoo&#34; number is the high point) that are impressively surrealistic for this era in Hollywood, although it proves to no avail in such a dull, incoherent film.&#39;

b&#39;After seeing the movie, I feel the father and the mother are both reasonable person, although not perfect at all. On the contrary, I don\&#39;t like the author, and his two sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is a person\&#39;s journal an accurate portrait of herself? No. Most of time people only write problems in her journal because she want to solve the problem. So a journal is always a more negative side of a person. In this movie, the author judge his mother\&#39;s life by her journal. Not a wise choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The author\&#39;s elder sister is so ugly, external and internal. First, she said her father\&#39;s second marriage is &#34;not fair&#34; for her mother. Then, she said she doesn\&#39;t love her mother. So, she don\&#39;t love both father and mother. I doubt she love anybody in the world. Her face is so ugly, just a reflection of her heart. Through out the movie, I feel the author and his sisters are lack of love and respect to their parents. However, I feel the father are mother are very loving to their children, even the author try to portrait them as cold, deceitful person.&#39;

b&#39;It is extremely rare that I see a movie from 1955 that I don\&#39;t love. Noir, JDs, Sci-fi, Drive-Ins; I dig it all the most. Robert Aldrich is a director who has done plenty of excellent work, and most of this cast has fine performances under their belt. So what went wrong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used to work in the Independent Film world, we used to talk about something called &#34;actors\&#39; movies.&#34; Actors\&#39; movies are movies that are unwatchable to anyone but other actors. Actors like &#34;actors\&#39; movies&#34; because they get to see ACTing - which is to say completely over-the-top melodrama. Actors love to be given the chance to totally let loose &#34;give it all they\&#39;ve got&#34; and they get a great satisfaction from watching other actors do so. In many interviews with actors they say &#34;he was a great director, he never interfered with me in any way.&#34; Actually that\&#39;s the opposite of good directing, because the whole POINT of having a director on the set is to keep the actors from making fools of themselves (which, given the chance, they will always do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently Robert Aldrich forgot that on this project. Or maybe he was ill. Or maybe he thought there was no hope for saving the script in the first place, so what the heck? Whatever the case, here is an example of a lesser-known movie that is best forgotten. The characters gesticulate, pontificate and generally ham it up all the way through. One thing I can say is realistic: it\&#39;s set in Hollywood and everyone acts like their petty problems are the most important thing in the world. Doesn\&#39;t make it fun to watch, but it is realistic. What isn\&#39;t realistic is that a producer so desperate to keep his star under contract is going to go out of his way to antagonize him in almost every conceivable way - including requiring him to engage in illegal activity. But this and other plot contradictions merely carry along the melodrama, increasing the opportunity for hand-wringing and shouted accusations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did manage to get to the end of this film, which makes it no worse than a &#34;3&#34; out of 10 in my book. But, why test your own endurance when there is so much else available to rent?&#39;

b&#34;When I first saw the previews for this movie on TV I thought that this could be a funny movie. I was wrong. All though I am not totally against movies that make fun of others. Some are actually funny such as the first scary movie. This was one of many that have been made as of late that are not. The humor in this film was anything but funny and was rather dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel the one of the biggest problems is that they poked fun at to many movies such as Varsity Blues, Friday Night Lights, Stick it, etc. And if you are anything like me you try to pick out each movie instead of paying attention to whats going on in this one. Even the adult humor in this movie was dry. Do yourself a favor and save you money and time and rent don&#39;t rent this movie&#34;

b&#34;I know a lot of people like this show and i apologise to people who think this show is awesome but it is the worst show ever created. Sure i&#39;m sure I would be a big fan of this show if Jeremy Clarkson wasn&#39;t on it. I mean I think that testing out cars and doing things like seeing whether a car can beat a aeroplane is awesome! But Jeremy Clarkson is just pathetic. Here are the reasons I hate this man: . He thinks it&#39;s cool to trick speed cameras that measure your average speed by taking measuring your distance and time by driving 200mph down the road and then resting for two hours. . He clearly thinks that he is better than Richard Hammond and James May. . He&#39;s got my best friend saying pathetic things. . He screams at kids just for taking a picture of him. I&#39;m sorry top gear but Jeremy Clarkson is a freak.&#34;

b&#39;When George Sluizer was told he could direct an American version of the book &#34;Het Gouden Ei&#34;/the movie &#34;Spoorloos&#34;(outside Holland, this movie has the name &#34;the Vanishing&#34; too), he was told that this would only go through if the ending was changed - He was told that \&#39;the American Audience\&#39; wouldn\&#39;t approve the original ending. Of course, the original ending is much better, and without it, the movie loses its impact. Because I have already put this in the trivia section, I won\&#39;t give the original ending and keep my comment spoiler-free. If you want to know the original ending, watch &#34;Spoorloos&#34; or read the book. This movie is absolute rubbish, and the first Kiefer Sutherland movie I don\&#39;t like. Watch the original Dutch movie, which is one of the best thrillers in the world.&#39;

b&#34;The most positive points in this film were the credits (text style) and some moments in Ice-T&#39;s acting. The story-line; two rival gangs having to fight it out, with the sub-plots of betrayal, power and change are well worn plots but in this case painful(very) to wade through. The decrepit scenery, which added slight believability in places, and questionable lighting, constantly distracted from any interest/identification with the characters (the shine off of the actress&#39;s forehead/nose was blinding, not to mention other scenes with the same problem.) Not even half way into the film I wanted to know more about how and why it came about as opposed to what was going on on screen. A disappointment if you have seen Ice-T in other roles. Kudos to other actors/actresses who seemed to get into their roles despite the weak direction; Corrupt&#39;s side kick and the other restaurant worker.&#34;

b&#39;I got this movie as a buy one get one deal at troma.com with The Ruining (which isn\&#39;t much better). The main reason I wanted it was to see Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods, the DVD is a double feature with that movie. I really didn\&#39;t know what Actium Maximus was at the time, and when I saw the trailer I got scared. It looked awful. But hey, what can you tell from the trailer? Well, apparently I could tell a lot. This movie honestly made no sens to me. The special effects were so terrible you cannot tell what in God\&#39;s name is going on. I understand Mark HIcks had a extremely low budget, but come on. And it is sad, because in the interview he sounded like this was to be an epic film and meant more than you could see. But sadly, watching the film is one of the most boring hour and 15 minutes of anyone\&#39;s life. It is so utterly painful to sit through. I really can\&#39;t even explain the plot to you because I didn\&#39;t understand it at all and I have sadly seen this film two times! Apparently they used some type of puppets for the &#34;alien dinosaurs&#34; like they did in Star Wars. But these special effects are awful, I can\&#39;t stress it enough. And most of the time bad special effects are okay but this film needed them badly. It takes place on some futuristic planet where alien dinosaurs battle each other and bad actors in hooded sweatshirts run around, and they look like they are in the kkk. And some box with a blue light on it is the president. I know in the interview Mark Hicks said something about making this a television pilot, well, I can see why this didn\&#39;t make it to CBS or NBC. There are two good things about this film. 1. the music is actually pretty good, it has an epic score that sticks in your head for days. And 2. Lloyd Kaufman\&#39;s introduction is as always hilarious. Overall, don\&#39;t waste your time but check out Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods!&#39;

b&#34;This is one of those inoffensive and mildly entertaining little movies that strive to make you to like them more. But like so many others, it&#39;s material isn&#39;t strong enough to successfully fill a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pitch is promising: three drag queens drive a bus through the Outback from Sydney to Alice Springs. They run into lots of trouble - with homophobic locals, with the engine, with their pasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real trouble is with the dialogue. The leads are fine (though Pearce&#39;s continual campness becomes tiresome), but the one-liners and epithets feel forced where they should be casually thrown away. Characters shouldn&#39;t laugh at their own gags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writer/director Elliott also feels the need to pile on the pleasingly incongruous shots of flamboyant drag costumes against stark desert backgrounds like so much cheap make-up. For a movie about self-confidence and just being yourself, it all seems very insecure with itself.&#34;

b&#34;I&#39;ve been hearing a lot of this new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in South East Asia over the last three years . Apparently it&#39;s on the thresh hold of mutating into something very contagious and millions upon millions of people are going to be wiped out in a global pandemic . Just thought I&#39;d mention this in case you haven&#39;t got round to writing your will yet .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d also thought I&#39;d mention it since I was watching something called CARRIERS tonight which wasn&#39;t about naval warfare but opens with a scene that&#39;s a cross between OUTBREAK and an episode of THE X FILES I saw many years ago . I thought I&#39;d be watching something with added resonance after hearing the stories about the danger posed by bird flu but after the not unimpressive opening CARRIERS descends into a cheap and cheerful TVM and like every other TVM you&#39;ll see the lead characters are female , one of which is a ballsy authority figure while the other lead female is a mother of young children . It goes without saying there&#39;s a sick child subplot too &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is irritating about the TVM format is that it overwhelms the potential of what could have been quite a good film if it was made for cinema . There&#39;s a fairly gory scene of someone coughing blood all over a nurses face and a very impressive jay walker getting run down stunt but these bits are quickly forgotten as the mood descends into family sentiment since this - And just about every other TVM ever made - was made for an essentially female audience&#34;

b&#39;There\&#39;s a thin line between being theatrical and being just plain forced. Forced acting. Forced takes. Forced plot. Even forced photography. There\&#39;s people who say &#34;the movie develops that way because it\&#39;s from Asia&#34; but I don\&#39;t see any kind of forced elements on Seven Samurai or Sonatine. There\&#39;s a thin line between being fiction (and every work of art it is, in it\&#39;s way, fiction) and being just unlikely.In a more personal way, I just don\&#39;t feel anything with the movie, it doesn\&#39;t take me anywhere, and I just can\&#39;t believe in the fictional world it is proposed. It just doesn\&#39;t feel right, there\&#39;s something in it or through that just doesn\&#39;t click.&#39;

b&#39;Amando DeOssorio was never one to let a lack of budget get in the way of telling one of his stories. His &#34;Blind Dead&#34; series started off great but had some truly laughable moments, such as shots of a small model boat in a water tank for &#34;The Ghost Galleon&#34;. In &#34;The Sea Serpent&#34;, he hits rock bottom and takes some notable actors along with him, telling the tale of a silly sock monster that brings google-eyed terror to a few water tanks and miniature aquariums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A vague opening sequence sets the stage and demonstrates an aborted military mission where American pilots, for some unknown reason, drop an atomic bomb (brazenly cartooned into the frame of the film) somewhere in the ocean off the coast of Spain. The military commander gives this order from an office that features a prominent American flag and a portrait of a deranged-looking Ronald Reagan, one of only a few things that makes this movie really seem like the Eighties. The other two are the hilariously inept subtitle that declares the year to be &#34;1.985&#34; and Tyria Power\&#39;s dated Sheena Easton hairdo, which would have looked really cool next to some ripped neon sweats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the kookiest monsters you will ever see rises from the depths, disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb. We learn that the errant atom bomb has killed off a great deal of the local fish. Unfortunately for our cast, it has no effect on the Sea Serpent, which swiftly descends on the coast of Spain for some miniature-set mayhem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when I say the monster is unrealistic, I am not exaggerating. It\&#39;s not just &#34;sort of&#34; fake looking. I\&#39;m sure the filmmakers did the best with the ten dollars that they seem to have been allotted, but most of the time it looks like it was made out of Crayola markers, a ping pong ball, and an old sock. Not only that, it has this ominous music that accompanies it wherever it goes, music that sounds so much like the &#34;Jaws&#34; theme that it\&#39;s a wonder nobody got sued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with Tyria Power, Timothy Bottoms and Ray Milland are caught slumming, and the dialogue could not have been any more dismal. Through a series of plot contrivances, our leading actors are thrown together in a quest to...well, I\&#39;m not sure what the purpose is. Bottoms and Power have got to prove the serpent is real in order to save their butts (he is blamed for a serpent-induced shipwreck, she is locked in the loony bin after a sighting). None of this matters, because by the end of the movie nothing has been resolved. Nobody admits the serpent is real, and it\&#39;s not even dead. Furthermore, Power and Bottoms are still on the lam from the law. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As illogical as it seems, nobody but our heroes knows that the serpent exists (despite numerous disappearances, a trashed lighthouse, and a crushed railroad bridge), and they embark on an extended non-adventure to track down and chase the monster away...not kill it, since they know they are no match for it. Their big plan is to use flares to scare it off. Although their scheme is botched, the serpent causes a big explosion in the water after it attacks a bridge support (don\&#39;t ask), and the giant sea snake is so frightened that it swims away. The critical viewer would wonder why the serpent wasn\&#39;t frightened off earlier in the movie when it caused a couple of big explosions after crashing into a dock. But never mind. It swims away, and our heroes are sure it\&#39;s gone forever. The end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only imagine the horror that the stars felt when they saw the completed film they just worked on. A lamebrain script and a couple of dim reaction shots could never have prepared them for the embarrassment of sharing screen time with a spliced-in sock puppet/stop motion beastie. At least the supporting characters got to have fun screaming and pretending to be swallowed by a giant serpent head. I\&#39;m not sure what was going on when they made this movie; the monster is cheap, but there are some rather elaborate miniature sets, so somebody did spend some time making those, not to mention the stop-motion animation involved. It\&#39;s seemingly played straight, although maybe this film\&#39;s sense of humor went over my head. In the end, the film is nothing more than an easy target for a drunken commentary. Watch it at a party for best results.&#39;

b&#34;Wings Hauser and son, Cole Hauser team up to make a film about Neo-nazi thugs targeting a gay man, and terrorising a city. Wings plays the hero, and his real-life son is the villain. Fairly low-budget film that has not many redeeming features, and for some reason, no one has seen it! Perhaps because it is quite a laughable and ridiculous film, and the studio realised this! Maybe Wings Hauser himself prevented the distribution of &#39;Skins&#39;, after seeing it himself! Maybe people just didn&#39;t want to comment on such a bad film! Oh well! I generally like Wings and Cole as actors, but this was a film that they both should have skipped. Wings directed, wrote and was the lead actor in &#39;Skins&#39;! An extremely bad and stupid film! 1/2 out of *****!&#34;

b&#34;This movie is very difficult to understand, why do the couple want to divorce ? No reason is given, we don&#39;t know anything about their life in Lisbon, and even nothing about Marie&#39;s job. We may only understand that a certain bore appeared in this life. We don&#39;t even know who took the initiative of asking the divorce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way of filming is kind of special : I didn&#39;t know the director&#39;s name before the end of the movie, when I read it on the screen, I understood why it was so slow, only 42 shots in a hundred minutes (I counted them) ! It reminded me of some Japanese movies I saw in the 90&#39;s, in fact we must accept that this is the expression of another culture even if the set is occidental. I don&#39;t know if this story would have suited a Japanese couple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can see the logic of the scenes but the result is a bore, anyway I decided to watch it to the end because I wanted to get the spirit and the meaning of it all. In fact, I only understood that the story of these two beings may not be over yet since the train leaves the station without Marie. This is few for such a long time ! I can&#39;t recommend this work.&#34;

b&#39;Not many people remember &#34;The Carey Treatment&#34;, and I can\&#39;t say I blame them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blake Edwards did this during his lean years (i.e. - between &#34;Pink Panther&#34; movies.) and for a story of a doctor turned detective (Coburn) working to solve a murder in his hospital, it\&#39;s actually pretty forgettable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coburn is dependable as always and O\&#39;Neill is beautiful as always but there just seems to be something missing from the proceedings. The story twists and turns aren\&#39;t very involving and even the climax, which is supposed to be nerve-wracking, is gut-wrenching instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A missed opportunity altogether, and an unfortunate one at that, since it was based on a Michael Crichton book. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, at least Crichton didn\&#39;t write a sequel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star. &#34;Carey&#34; on, Coburn.&#39;

b&#39;I rented this movie, because I noticed the cover in the video rental store. I saw Nolte, Connely, Madsen, 40\&#39;s time setting, and thought &#34;hmm, can\&#39;t be too bad.&#34; Unfortunately, after watching it, my impression was &#34;not too good&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its kind of a Chinatown ripoff, but the worst part is that other than Nolte, the other members of the squad didn\&#39;t get enough screen time. But its a decent movie to see once I guess. And Melanie\&#39;s role was small enough that she wasn\&#39;t given a chance to be a nuisance.&#39;

b&#34;Wow, I was told this would be a B movie worth watching. I feel that I was misled after seeing this preview event. The plot is a twisted make of several films at best. Even the title is a take on another film if you can give the movie that much credit. I am sorry to say that I was taken to the cleaners. I wouldn&#39;t waste your time on this one. This movie appears to be a bunch of wannabes who got together and made a poor idea of a movie on a weekend with a borrowed camera. Being in the entertainment business, I can judge a decent film and this one deserves to be shelved or discarded. My advice, stick to a classic like the 1979 Dawn of the Dead. On a scale of 1 to 10 even a 1 is being nice to producers because this movie BLOWS. (Below Limit Of What Sucks) The producers need to stay with their daytime jobs. If you do view the movie please be honest in your posting, this one seems to have been hyped up and inflated by a few. There are a few who have seen this for what it is and posted correctly. Sorry, but, I have to say this is one to be skipped.&#34;

b&#39;In fact, everyone responsible for this dreck ought to be whipped, dragged, and hung! IF this is what great Eugene O\&#39;Niell drama is like I never want to be victim to viewing it ever again. There are so many things WRONG w/ this feature where does one begin? First, Elmer Bernstein\&#39;s bombastic score is present thru out the entire film even in the quiet scenes where background music subtracts from the character\&#39;s motivations. Second, these characters are NOT pleasant people and while some reviewers might enjoy that I personally disliked every scene in which Ives ate up the scenery, but that was the way his characters was written: to be disliked. W/ Loren it just never is made clear whether she\&#39;s good or bad \xc2\x85 and all her babbling about how she\&#39;s going to change things back to the way they were before the baby arrives \xc2\x85 well, I saw what was coming clearly. Perkins is miscast and then he plays the role like a warm-up for Norman Bates (which he played two years later) even wanting to take blame for the murder at the end. Hokey! Third, this film is a studio sound-stage production and it suffers because of it. The story would have benefited from location shooting to develop a sense of &#34;place&#34; regarding the farm (which all the main leads are fighting over). As it is filmed there\&#39;s no sense of value to the property because the film has a studio sound-stage feel to it that isn\&#39;t convincing. This is a really awful film.&#39;

b&#39;The film is nothing else than an exposition of nudity. Has anyone noticed that all three main female characters appear naked? It looks like the only winning bet for Portuguese filmmakers is to include some (if not a lot) of nudity of the local stars, together with slang which otherwise, in the nowadays Portuguese society, is repulsed with horror. If you watch advertising for Portuguese films at Portuguese TVs, they all have included a &#34;hot&#34; scene from the movie. I\&#39;m not saying, by any means, that Portuguese society is alienated; just that the movie industry does not seem capable of finding others ways of success. Going back to the movie... There is nothing left from the spirit of the book, which is a masterpiece. The film could have been a good one, had there been emphasized the real idea of the book (of actuality at any time) and not the strictly erotic part. It had almost all the ingredients... but the &#34;chef&#34; was awful...&#39;

b&#39;With its few touches of surrealism, LWHTRB works as low-grade horror, but as a major follow-up statement to the original, it flounders miserably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Things begin somewhat promising during the telefilm\&#39;s opening credits... We see and hear several interesting shots and sounds: The Baby\&#39;s black crib with the overhanging, inverted cross; the kitchen knife Rosemary carried into the Castevette\&#39;s apartment and dropped in shock (the utensil is shown sticking out of the hardwood floor); and the emptiness of the Bramford itself, without tenants or furniture (voice-overs can be heard here from the previous film\&#39;s dialog). Interesting too is the Easter Egg hunt the titular child participates in (the eggs and baskets are also black). Once the story gets rolling, it never really \&#39;rolls\&#39;... And what happens to Rosemary when she boards that driverless bus, and is whisked away to God-knows-where? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patty Duke (a poor replacement for Mia Farrow), Ray Milland and Tina Louise (as the Southwestern Whore who raises the child, &#34;Adrian/Andrew&#34;) head this almost-star cast, with Ruth Gordon reprising her &#34;Minnie&#34; role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although not a total failure, this sequel-of-sorts should have been released in book form first, then maybe we all could have been a bit better informed... and not left totally in the dark. A fairly recent sequel novel &#34;Son of Rosemary&#34; (1999?) is the legitimate followup by Ira Levin himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;

b&#34;Greeted with derision by most critics when it first appeared, &#39;Frenzy&#39; has recently done the rounds of UK TV. I remember seeing it on its original release, and thinking then that if Hitchcock wanted to parade some kind of screen confession about his ingrained misogynism, he couldn&#39;t have found a nastier little vehicle to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Time alters perspective, and so what was nauseatingly bad in 1972 might, all these years later, be worthy of upward re-evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might. . . but not. &#39;Frenzy&#39; is dross. The dross of an ageing director who desperately wanted to exploit the artistic freedom of 70s movie making without seeming to realise that freedom imposes its own obligations -- notably, the need to bring integrity to one&#39;s work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s none here. And not much evidence of the earlier directorial brilliance, either -- the switch from spine-tingling implicit to odious explicit is neither shocking nor, for a supreme stylist, stylish: it&#39;s just banal (the prolonged murder scene is precisely that: prolonged, without pace, without reason, without purpose other than the cheapest of directorial desires to appear as contemporary an artiste as, say, that other acclaimed practitioner of cheap sleaze, Michael Winner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it goes from bad to worse, with dialog that defies any human provenance (not least in the ludicrous diversion into the Home Life of Our Dear Wooden Inspector, and his wife&#39;s cooking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the scene that best sums up &#39;Frenzy&#39; (and endures as the most explicit indictment of Hitchcock&#39;s persona) is the clunking exchange between two lawyers in a bar, where they discuss the serial killings and then agree that at least the women had a good time first by being raped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember my revulsion at that scene back in &#39;72, and it&#39;s still undimmed, because this wasn&#39;t Hitchcock being clever, or sardonic, or trying to make some universal point (big themes, big truths, were not Hitchcock&#39;s forte, nor personal preference.) It was just Hitchcock, allowing a reflection of his own distorted mirror on life to shine through the texture of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calling &#39;Frenzy&#39; Hitchcock&#39;s last great masterpiece is to betray little if any understanding of just what Hitchcock actually achieved in the way of cinematic trickery, cinematic thrills, and dazzling cinematic mastery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Frenzy&#39; is therefore now what it always was: a cheap, nasty, and ham-fisted movie that did no service to any of those involved, or to the memory of a film-maker who really was, in his Hollywood days, one of the greatest there has ever been.&#34;

b&#39;This is the first and as far as I can tell, the only completed production of &#34;Heart of Darkness&#34; ever released. Prior to starting on &#34;Citizen Kane,&#34; Orson Welles shot some test footage for a version of &#34;Heart of Darkness&#34; that was to be filmed entirely in what would now be called &#34;POV&#34;, where we would see everything from the point of view of the main character Charlie Marlow; he would be seen only fleetingly in mirrors, windows, water, etc. The film was never made. The &#34;POV&#34; technique was used, not too successfully, in 1947 in &#34;The Lady in the Lake,&#34; with Robert Montgomery starring as Philip Marlowe. Presumably, the coincidence of the two &#34;Marlow(e)&#34; characters is just that. Of course, Francis Coppola\&#39;s &#34;Apocalypse Now&#34; was based on &#34;Heart of Darkness.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short novel &#34;Heart of Darkness&#34; by the Polish-born British writer Joseph Conrad, first serialized in a British literary magazine in 1899, features one of his favorite alter egos, ship captain Charlie Marlow, who also narrates the short story &#34;Youth&#34; and indirectly tells the story of &#34;Lord Jim.&#34; Marlow, temporarily out of work, decides to take a job captaining a river boat for a Belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of King Leopold II\&#39;s personal fiefdom, the cruelly misnamed Congo Free State. Marlow travels from London to Brussels, signs on with the company, and is told that his mission is to take a boat up the Congo River to a far inland station headed by one of the company\&#39;s most productive agents in the colony, a German named Kurtz. Shipments of ivory, latex (for the production of rubber) and other products from Kurtz\&#39;s station have ceased, and no word has come downriver from Kurtz for some time. There are rumors that he has &#34;gone native.&#34; Marlow is to investigate, take any necessary action, and make a report on his return. He takes passage down the West African coast to the mouth of the Congo, is delayed for weeks while he is forced to repair his boat at the company station on the coast, and finally sets out upriver to find Kurtz\&#39;s station. The river, the heat, the vegetation, the wildlife, the insects, the people, all take their toll on his endurance, his imagination, and his mental resources. He finds Kurtz ill, half-mad, and close to death. The final encounter and the death of Kurtz are almost an anticlimax, especially since Conrad is so obscure about what actually happens that we are left to puzzle it out for ourselves. This is a novel where you close the book vaguely dissatisfied with the ending but nevertheless treasuring the story for its amazing atmospherics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &#34;Heart of Darkness&#34; was filmed with Guyana in Central America standing in for West Africa. It is best where the novel is at its greatest disadvantage: Actually showing us First World urbanites what a boat trip up a tropical river would look like. But the rest of the film was forgettable. Tim Roth does his best as Marlow, but so much about the plot, characterizations, and character relationships has been altered beyond recognition that you wonder why they bothered. If the aim was to make Conrad\&#39;s story for the screen, why didn\&#39;t they leave it alone? It\&#39;s unreasonable to expect that no compromises will be made when a book is made into a movie, but so many changes were made that to me had no cinematic justification that you wonder whether we are simply dealing with incompetent screenwriters and cinematographers. Most disappointing of all was John Malkovich as Kurtz. He was completely miscast and simply flubs the role. Everything about him is wrong: His looks, his acting style, his voice, his accent, everything. A vastly better choice would have been someone like Bruno Ganz (unlike Malkovich, an actual German, like the character).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very disappointing production and I would recommend it only after you\&#39;ve read the book if you want to depend on more than your imagination to get a visual picture of a boat trip up the Congo River circa 1900.&#39;

b&#34;You can only describe this with one word and that would be WOW!!! Wow, I really did not think piece of crap like this could ever be released. If you watch a movie titled ninja then you expect to see at least some cool martial artists, right? However, none of these guys know any martial arts whatsoever and it seems like they went to china and picked the first people they saw on the street and trained them for a day in martial arts, that&#39;s the level of their martial arts skills! The actors are way overacting, the special effects are ridiculous and there is not any plot that makes any sense. This is the worst martial arts movie I&#39;ve ever seen and I have seen plenty!&#34;

b&#39;...but other than that, there\&#39;s almost no redeeming social value to this sequel to the original Poseidon Adventure. Where the heck are all the people from the original, including the rescue crew? Michael Caine undergoes his most humiliating performance to date (although he later trumps himself with Jaws 4 down the road). Slim Pickens is just embarrassing as a stereotyped Texas, and generally you just have to wonder, &#34;Why did they bother?&#34; Irwin Allen\&#39;s last stab at cashing in on the disaster craze, I guess.&#39;

b&#39;Star Trek V definitely earns the dubious distinction of being the weakest film in the Star Trek series. Despite the good acting efforts by the actors, it suffered from a general lack of funding from Paramount Pictures. Paramount Pictures was not enthusiastic about this film at its very onset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie begins with the Enterprise crew enjoying their extended shore leave as a reword for saving the Earth from total ecological disaster. Their shore leave is cut short when a disturbance occurs on Nimbus III, the Planet of Intergalactic Peace. Captain Kirk and the Enterprise arrive at Nimbus III only to have their ship hijacked by Sybok, Spock\&#39;s half-brother. Sybok brainwashes the crew of the Enterprise and sets it on a suicide mission to rendezvous with &#34;God&#34; just past the Great Barrier at the center of our galaxy. Captain Kirk must then figure out a way to regain control of his ship and to fend off the Enterprise\&#39;s Klignon pursuers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bright spot in the film is the acting and directing. William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Laurence Luckinbill, and the rest of the cast all give good performances. William Shatner also does a pretty good job directing this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the film suffered from a general lack of enthusiasm and funding. First, the part of Sybok was initially offered to Sean Connery, but he refused. So, Laurence Luckinbill got the part. Second, many of the special effects were severely cut back ... reducing the movies entertaining potential. Third, the scene that depicts the arrival at the Great Barrier left much to be desired. Finally, the romance between Scotty and Uhura in this film did not make much sense at all ... considering that no such romance ever occurred prior to this point in the Star Trek universe and it was never explained how such a romance could suddenly materialize between Star Treks IV and V.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very weak film. You should probably just skip this film and move on to Star Trek VI. After all, the cast and crew made Star Trek VI partly to bail themselves out after their debacle with Star Trek V.&#39;

b&#34;Okay, so maybe the acting wasn&#39;t bad, but I am typing this review as a public service to prevent anyone else who happens upon the intriguing beginning of this telefilm from throwing away two hours of their life waiting for some plot development that will never come. The chief investigator has a gut feeling who did away with the missing marine officer (Guy), and few people other than uninvolved bystanders and the accusee seem to dispute her. So what is the point of staying with this drama? Beats the heck out of me. I kept thinking (or hoping) there would be some sort of plot twist or new revelation, but none was forthcoming. In summary, I cannot think of a single reason to sit and watch this pointless TV movie, based on a true story or not.&#34;

b&#34;Gordon goes over the top in typical Full Moon fashion, but that&#39;s to be expected. Combs is surprisingly low-key, keeping his performance at a more realistic level than we are used to seeing. Also gone is the usual Stuart Gordon &#39;tongue-in-cheek&#39; black humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is quite effective in showing Combs&#39; break down and his final heroic act to save his wife &amp; daughter. You actually feel sympathy for his character, despite his short-comings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I was more surprised at the nudity and borderline porno sex scene, than I was shocked by the graphic violence &amp; gore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not classic Gordon, but certainly something you might enjoy if you&#39;ve seen his more famous films.&#34;

b&#39;The video box for \&#39;Joyride\&#39; says &#34;starring second generation superstars&#34;, and one can\&#39;t help but feel sad. Granted, Melanie Griffith has gone on to bigger and better things...but who cares about the rest of the cast? So with that being the pathetic attention grabber on the box I was foolish enough to purchase the film for a dollar thinking I would be in the land of \&#39;so-bad-they\&#39;re-good 70\&#39;s films\&#39; Eh, not so much. While so many aimless 70\&#39;s youth films (or plain ol\&#39; 70\&#39;s films for that matter) tried so hard to say something deep and meaningful, \&#39;Joyride\&#39; doesn\&#39;t even try. It\&#39;s just aimless. It is devoid of any interest whatsoever. Each character is so poorly conceived that it\&#39;s no wonder these actors look so listless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell the movie is about three 20-somethings who go to Alaska to start a business, but instead get robbed and then have to find work. They get beat up, eat dog food, steal cars, rob banks. It\&#39;s all very typical but on top of that it\&#39;s executed in the most mundane way possible. There are no surprises and the flow is so bad, and the actions of the characters so ambiguous that you can miss several scenes and not mind at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you\&#39;re a fan of Melanie Griffith\&#39;s breasts - then this is a must-see. That\&#39;s still not enough to get this above the lowest rating I can give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Line: &#34;Jesus, everything is biology with you.&#34; * out of ****&#39;

b&#39;This is easily one of the worst films I\&#39;ve seen in many years. I started viewing the film not expecting much and that is exactly what it delivered....not much! In fact, it ended up delivering even less than I expected. My first reaction when I saw the opening portions of the film was that I would probably end up rating it a &#34;4&#34;. I thought that it seemed to have reasonably good photography and a haunting atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the film progressed however, the rating kept going down and down in my mind mainly due to pedestrian acting and a plot that went from being just plain silly and tasteless at the beginning to being both silly and repugnant near the end. By the time the movie was over, I was willing to rate it no more than a &#34;1&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t waste your time or money on this one.&#39;

b&#39;Make no mistake about, High School Bigshot is a bad movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High School Bigshot is about a geek who makes a plan to become rich and get the girl. However, he goes about it all wrong, and of course by the end of the movie ends up dead along with a few other people, thankfully including the girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moral of the story is all women care about is wealth. Also for us men, I guess we\&#39;re just supposed to accept we either &#34;have it&#34; or &#34;we don\&#39;t have it&#34;! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could easily see how this movie could be rated a 1, however it is above that of the very worst of movies. The acting\&#39;s not totally horrible, and production values aren\&#39;t ultra-terrible. Over all it\&#39;s a bad movie and not worth viewing for many reasons. If you insist of course at torturing yourself, watch the MST version. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/10 (maybe a 1.5/10)&#39;

b&#39;I have to agree with the other two comments. I waited over a month to see this great new show A&amp;E had been hyping. What a disappointment!!! The show is pretty much all about Ryan Buell. His voice-overs are campy, not creepy. It sounds as if he is talking into a can. As of the second episode, which is roughly 30 minutes or so (if you take out the commercials) he is being chased or followed by something that he knows is demonic. He can\&#39;t say the name, anytime someone needs to convey that name, they write it on a piece of paper and hand it to someone else. Not particularly informative or entertaining or believable for the rest of us. Why can\&#39;t he say the name?...supposedly it would give the demon more power. Funny, I always thought demons wanted to hide their true identities. If you know the exact name of the demon, doesn\&#39;t it make it easier for you to cast them out. Now the next episode, which airs in just a little while is titled &#34;exorcism&#34;. So is Ryan in need of an exorcism already? Not to say that it couldn\&#39;t happen but the show so far has not given any evidence or proof of anything. I can tell Ryan that if I were a small child, hell if I was an adult, and someone gave me a little bottle of holy water to chase away something that was terrifying me, I would look elsewhere for help!!! Besides which, if you don\&#39;t use holy water &amp; blessings, etc. in the right way don\&#39;t you risk just further infuriating whatever is already mad at you? I will probably watch tonight but if these episodes are as ridiculous as the first, it will probably be the last time I watch it!&#39;

b&#39;What a shame. What a terrible shame. The table was set, the candles were lit, the guests had arrived... and then...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... well nothing really. Just pretentious drivel. It could have been great, OK maybe not great, but it could have been very good. All the elements were there but at the end of the day the bottle was empty: NO LIGHTNING! How that happened is a mystery with everything at the director\&#39;s disposal...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;... the story was quite brave although it certainly needed considerable work with possibly several finishing rewrites to fix the story and tighten up the characters a lot (the only thing that was consistently and constantly and unnecessarily tight was the cinematography, but i\&#39;ll get to that). But the direction was lousy, the acting was just that: _a-C-T-i-n-G_ with a heavy side of cheese and lots of ham, and then the cinematography...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...well that was something to behold! But only if you are in film school\&#39;s &#34;Cinematography 101 how to never ever use a professional movie camera under any circumstances&#34;. Obviously the student had fallen asleep through part of the lecture\&#39;s introduction and only heard &#34;... use a professional movie camera...&#34; then blissfully back to la la land as the sentence finished off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can i say; amateurish and pretentious to the last! I can only see this film meant to appeal as a Chick Flick because it\&#39;s supposed to be sad, but then falls flat and just ends up being \&#39;sad\&#39; (as an excuse for a movie)... so that even those \&#39;Chicks\&#39; wouldn\&#39;t be fooled by this schlockenspiel! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I felt bad for Miss Diaz. She\&#39;s a lot better at her craft than what this film allowed her to be, even though she was totally TOTALLY miscast. Actually i feel sorry for everyone in this movie except the director and (you guessed it) the cinematographer! I say \&#39;1st against the wall for them when the revolution comes!\&#39; OK, not really, after all &#34;it was only a movie&#34; but perhaps a good &#34;tar and feather and running out of town&#34; might be more satisfying or at the very least a lot more entertaining!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TTFN :-(&#39;

b&#34;The worse film i have every seen. Like the other honest reviewers, it is just an excuse for getting naked birds with their juggs out. Don&#39;t get wrong, naked women isn&#39;t a bad thing but there is another film genre for that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boyfriends beware. I sold this to my girlfriend as a classic bike gang fest (due to reviews) to be greeted with every other scene full of naked women gyrating about the place. Slap in the chops for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes me laugh the most is all the dogey bike dives they went to in the film were full of models with the works cosmetically - what biker bars have these? They are usually slightly haggard with tattoos and far saggier juggs! Completely unrealistic.The acting is terrible, loads of pointless swearing and a complete waste of time storyline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did anyone check out Vinnie Jones&#39;s attempt at an American accent? Its as embarrassing as his football skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid like the plague. The only reason you would watch this film is if you are a young lad who cant access p@rn and have nicked it from their parents movie collection for a few pervy kicks!&#34;

b&#39;I once saw a bit of this film, and was interested to see the full thing just to see why the critics give it two stars, the result being that I agree. Basically the film begins with Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire) telling all his Muppet chums that they have lost everything, and he ends sitting depressed (and possibly thinking about suicide) on the bench. Meanwhile, in another world (Heaven) angel Daniel (David Arquette, who had already been in Muppets from Space) visits the \&#39;Boss\&#39; (Whoopi Goldberg, another reason I wanted to see the film) to show that Kermit really needs help. In the flashbacks, it shows Kermit, Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson, not the original and better Frank Oz), Gonzo (Dave Goelz), Fozzie Bear (also Jacobson), Pepe the Prawn (Bill Barretta) and all the other Muppets have prepared a stage show for many people to see in the Christmas holiday, and it all seems to be going well. But the really mean Rachel Bitterman (Joan Cusack) is determined to either shut the show or the theatre down, and Kermit is doing everything possible to make sure that doesn\&#39;t happen. Of course, Kermit fails the last time, and Bitterman tells him that they are finished, and she can officially take the theatre. This is where Daniel is sent as Kermit\&#39;s guardian angel to try and help him, but Kermit is not in the mood, and eventually ends up saying &#34;I wish I was never born&#34;. Obviously, you can recognise the spoof of It\&#39;s a Wonderful Life, with Kermit as the George Bailey, and Cusack as the Mr. Potter, and in the end, obviously Kermit realises how much he means to everyone, and goes back to find the theatre saved as historical landmark. Also starring Whitmire as Rizzo the Rat and Beaker; Goelz as Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf; Barretta as Dr. Teeth, Rowlf the Dog and Swedish Chef; Jacobson as Animal and Yoda (the only character who sounds similar to Oz\&#39;s version), William H. Macy as Glenn, Matthew Lillard as Luc Fromage, Carson Daly, Molly Shannon; Scrubs\&#39; Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, Neil Flynn, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes, Mel Brooks as Joe Snow; Brian Henson as Scooter and Janice; Jerry Nelson as Robin the Frog, Statler, Pops and Floyd Pepper, and Kevin Clash as Sam the Eagle. The most memorable moment for me is the stage spoof of Moulin Rouge, besides that and the well known faces in it, not fantastic. It was nominated the Emmy for Outstanding Music and Lyrics for the song &#34;Everyone Matters&#34;. The Muppets were number 47 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Adequate!&#39;

b&#39;When I heard the film was to be released and the theme of what it was about, I felt very curious. But when I saw it was the biggest deception of my life. Technically speaking, the sound is poor, you can tell about man dialogs that were remade on studio that are poorly achieved in the final mix. Secondo of all, the photography is mediocre, some part of the films show some soldiers with night vision goggles, and the way the cinematographer achieves that &#34;dark night&#34; is by illuminated everything like if they were in an actual military base with lights, there\&#39;s no reference used of the moonlight, my god! Thir but not least, most of the ac tings are really poor, it\&#39;s totally not believable the roll of the wife of one of the soldier, her performance it\&#39;s pretty poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great disappointing, shame of the jury who chose to send this movie to represent Colombia on the Oscars.&#39;

b&#34;Strange things happen to Americans Will (Greg Evigan), Maura (Alexandra Paul) and their young daughter Aubrey (Briana Evigan, Greg&#39;s real life daughter) when they move into a large, newly inherited house in Ireland. Crusty corpses are found in the cellar, a turkey squirts blood, furniture moves and the ghosts of a dead child and a cackling old lady show up to scare the little girl. Paranormal investigators are eventually called in to banish the evil spirits, but Maura becomes possessed anyway and chases everyone around with a meat cleaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is full of cliches, but there&#39;s a standout performance from Alexandra Paul... too bad it doesn&#39;t belong in this movie (nor any other I can think of off hand)! She can barely keep a straight face and her over-emoting and hysterical screaming tantrums are a joy to behold. In any case, she&#39;s a lot more interesting to watch than anything else in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Score: 3 out of 10&#34;

b&#34;I wish I could have voted this movie a ten, it&#39;s that funny. If they had intended for it to be that funny I would have given it a ten. I have to give it a 1, but it&#39;s the funniest darn 1 you&#39;ll ever want to watch. See the giant blur flash across the screen! Where did it come from? What is it? It flies, it terrifies, it&#39;s electrifying, it&#39;s on strings! This bird has real personality.

b&#39;Eric Roberts &#34;stars&#34; in this Tommy Lee Thomas debut prison film. He plays the leader of a corrupt ring of guards. Though evil by most people\&#39;s standards, his character is the kind of guy who is nice enough to give you supporting wires while you hang chained to the ceiling as he tortures you with &#34;Lethal Weapon&#34; electric prods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie has an intricate plot about prison corruption that makes absolutely no sense. Thomas has Clint Eastwood\&#39;s squinter eyes, Dolph Lundgren\&#39;s one-liners, the acting abilities of JCVD and the body of the tiniest guy you knew in school who took steroids after graduation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Martin &#34;Cobra Kai&#34; Kove\&#39;s career shares this low point with Roberts, in the film it is difficult to tell if Kove\&#39;s character is supposed to be drunk for the entire movie or if Kove just came that way. I couldn\&#39;t blame him if he did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately for all involved, this movie has a &#34;so bad that it\&#39;s good&#34; quality that can be fun IF YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BETTER TO DO.&#39;

b&#34;There is only one reason this movie is watchable. Till Schweiger. He is such a good actor the movie isn&#39;t completely terrible. Uwe Boll please take up another career. The special effects and action are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that Kevin Smith (An evening with...) talked about Tim Burton not ever reading the Batman comics and it showed. Uwe Boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about. If you two ever want to know how it is done go see Andrzej Bartkowiak. Doom was one of the best video games to film adaptations ever. Some people may disagree, but if you watch the movie you can see that the guys at ID had a lot to do with Doom. It doesn&#39;t seem like anyone at UBIsoft was even near this production.&#34;

b&#34;There&#39;s a certain irony in a parody of the Gothic genre being turned into a mess of clich\xc3\xa9s by filmmakers who either had no idea what the story&#39;s purpose was, or just didn&#39;t care. All of the hallmarks of your average family film are present- rambunctious younger siblings, a grumpy teenager who doesn&#39;t want to move, unsympathetic parents who are unable to see the apparition, and of course a romantic subplot. The movie has very little in common with Wilde&#39;s original story, which was largely written to poke fun at the melodramatic Gothic novellas that were all the rage at the time. If Wilde saw this version, he&#39;d probably laugh- and then of course, write a parody. One can only hope that the children who watched this bland, mass-produced pap eventually discovered the wit and sparkle of the original version.&#34;

b&#39;I can\&#39;t believe that I actually sat thru this entire film. A friend rented it because the jacket made it sound good. In it\&#39;s defense, the jacket was correct; there was a supposed haunted room that someone slept in overnight. From the jacket, it sounded like this was on par with Freddy, Jason, or maybe &#34;The Shining.&#34; It couldn\&#39;t be farther from the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a fan of minimalist and/or surrealist films, you may enjoy it. If you\&#39;re looking for a good fright movie, or a couple of thrills, go rent Jason vs Freddy IV -- you\&#39;ll have a much better night.&#39;

b&#39;This movie is crappy beyond any limits. It\&#39;s incredible - a very bad ripoff from Jaws and other (better) shark movies. A really bad one - everything is really pathetic. The story is purest crap, actors are bad, effects very cheap, no creativity whatsoever. It looks like some really debilitated children took Jaws script and arranged it randomly, then its parents took their 8 mm camera and shot the movie with their neighbors. The music is really inappropriate, just some &#34;elevator&#34; music, bland and overly optimistic when nothing happens, then slightly less optimistic when shark is around or when children gets depressed (again listens to VERY LOUD elevator music). Carlo Maria (the author) should be so ashamed he should ask for his name to be erased from the titles!! The movie acts as perfect demonstration how crappy music will destroy ***ANY*** scene which is supposed to be thrilling. There is one major difference to Jaws though: In the beginning of Jaws there are comments about stupid people who try to kill shark with dynamite. Well, there is an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite. When this does not work, guys take an ***BIG LOAD*** of dynamite and spent like 1/4 of movie by placing explosives in some sunken ship. This IS really original way to catch the fish I have to admit! They use so much dynamite like they would try to kill a battleship (I would guess Bismarck class of battleship) or to dig another Panama channel. This is just incredible. I\&#39;m glad they did not try to use napalm-flamethrower or tactical nuclear strike to eliminate this bad, bad approximately 2 m shark. Well, there is mystic disappearing native Indian (who looks like German pensioner) too in this mess. This is not a movie, this is a warning example how bad the movies may be! As a warning it is useful. But the public should be protected from this crap. Most of Italian movies is bad, but this... this is really exceptional in the worst sense of the word.&#39;

b&#39;You have to see this. I could not stop laughing about the stupidities I saw in this movie even late after the event. There is maybe a million of individual mistakes and stupidities in this movie. The acting is bad. The story is so predictable and flat. The effects are like 50 years old. The supposed thriller is nowhere. You will not enjoy the movie, but you will laugh at it and enjoy laughing at it a long time after it. We had a great time AFTER the movie. Truly. Me and my friend spent entire 40mins long bus trip home chatting about this movie like we have seen next Oscar winner. Sadly we were talking about all those bad things we had just seen.&#39;

b&#39;I have watched this movie twice in the past six months (what I go through so you don\&#39;t have to).The first viewing left me half crazed and babbling.The second viewing at 5am on a rainy morn was a little better.I only screamed in agony once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Seems Pocona (The Aztec Mummy)had the hots for a certain Aztec Princess who was&#34;supposed to keep her maiden&#34;.Obviously they gave each other the business and were put to death for it.(Now that is severe!).But before they are the film tries to put us to death with a screeching Aztec ceremony.The singing will make your ears bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Anyhow there is the usual reincarnation nonsense. Not to mention a treasure map on a breastplate &amp; bracelet guarded by that swathed slob,Pocona.By this time Pocona looks like he\&#39;s been on a 2000 year bender and is after the defilers of his tomb.His groans &amp; moans sounds like he has a bad case of Montezuma\&#39;s revenge(or he read the script for this movie).That will make your breath stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; An evil Dr Von Krupp appears wanting the Aztec treasure(possibly to finance acting lessons &amp; screenwriting classes for cast &amp; crew).He is called The Bat because in The Curse Of The Aztec Mummy he wore a bat like cape, hat and something like a ski mask over his face.Guess it\&#39;s better than the Laughing Fat Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Bat in typical mad scientist fashion wants to rule the world. He stresses this by rolling his eyes,laughing maniacally and chewing the scenery.He has cobbled together an invincible robot.Looks like the \&#39;bot was made from a garbage can, a chandelier and the grill of a 1957 Buick.This will make your eyes bleed.A company even takes credit for making this tin can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well the mighty showdown between Pocona and the Robot takes place in the Mummy\&#39;s new crypt having been made homeless earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; About half of this movie is culled from &#34;La Aztec Momia&#34;never released in the US in its original form but in a chopped atrocity from Jerry Warren(see my review on &#34;Attack Of The Mayan Mummy&#34;) and &#34;Curse Of The Aztec Mummy&#34;.The robot is frankly stupid as are most of the characters.If that and the plot doesn\&#39;t make you howl with laughter nothing will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My first impression was so bad it would have gotten a one. But after seeing &#34;Mayan Mummy&#34;(which is a movie deserving of being burned) and watching &#34;Robot&#34; again, it garners a 3.You have to watch this with no expectations at all. Then it can be naively pleasant.&#39;

b&#39;Cruddy, innocent..no smoking, drinking or bikers, but Jeremy Slate (good actor) and Jocelyn Lane (good actress) make this moronically feasible for a bad biker flick, post-biker (exploit) time. They knew it, we knew it...Adam Roarke and Slate are wasted..but they lived on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 3 out of 10. Best performance = Jocelyn Lane. Lane is the ONLY really to catch the final exploit biker film after RUN, ANGEL, RUN (which also has good actors - like Don Stroud, etc.). It was over. They knew it. They were trying to make a living. But, Jocelyn Lane (from two Elvis bad flicks, TICKLE ME and something bad one) in yellow and leather is the modern hot chick with J. Slate fighting for honor. It\&#39;s worth seeing, but it sucks. But check it out. Well worth non-biker, non-smoker, non-boozing, &#34;biker&#34; types with hot chicks.&#39;

b&#34;spoilers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is not action packed; it&#39;s slow and boring. It&#39;s not funny or exciting, it&#39;s predictable and plays on cheap sentimentality and vague patriotism. The special effects are not imaginative or impressive. They are noisy and uninspired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting talent is wasted on hopelessly stupid one-liners and clich\xc3\xa9s. These are spouted by characters they ought to just be called `gentle giant black man,&#39; `eccentric genius who is about to crack,&#39; `square jawed hero coming of age,&#39; `by-the-book coward,&#39; `luckless gambler who lives by a code of honor,&#39; `impulsive princess&#39; and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the writing! How many undramatic countdowns did they think they could fit in this thing? Does a scene where people have to defuse a bomb by cutting one or another wire even count as fiction anymore? The drama of the last 15 minutes of the movie depends on the audience caring if some jerk can put aside his personal differences with Ben Affleck and say bye bye to Liv Tyler in time TO SAVE THE EARTH. All the work is done; we just have to wait a couple more seconds for Harry Stamper, the jerk, to toss off a few cotton candy lines. I know Bruce Willis is a generally charismatic guy, but his Harry Stamper character is an obnoxious bore. I thought he earned the Golden Razzy he was awarded for this role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the movie is so long, the plot so obvious, and the dialogue so disposable, one can&#39;t help but notice the lame inaccuracies, inconsistencies and plot holes. 800 feet into something the size of TX is less than a pinprick. Try walking 800 feet into TX and see how close to the center you are. After all the discussion about the artificial gravity on the Russian station, it appears to be arbitrary once inside. Actually, gravity comes and goes throughout the movie. Does it make any sense that anyone besides Michael Bay would give these morons a couple shuttles and send them to blow up an asteroid threatening the earth?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sentimental phone/insurance/cola commercial style montages were revolting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like action movies. Really. This one is boring, stupid and really stuck on itself. It deserves hatred and scorn because it&#39;s everything Hollywood&#39;s most expensive efforts have become - a bunch of cheap cliches running from one expensive explosion to another. Oh yes, the whole thing is permeated by a Neanderthal conservative outlook on sex, politics and so on.&#34;

b&#34;Jason Lee does well to give this doggy movie fleeting promise, but it&#39;s not enough to distinguish it from any other bland family comedy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This live-action, CG-enhanced adventure sees a shamed police dog (Jason Lee) transformed into a super-dog via an accident in the lab of scheming scientist Dr. Simon Barsinister (Peter Dinklage). Underdog sets about saving the city while attempting to keep his identity secret - a challenge given that he can both talk and fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odd gag raises a smile, but Underdog&#39;s human sidekicks (James Belushi and Alex Neuberger as father and son) are as dull as the predictable storyline.

b&#34;So, it&#39;s Friday night and you want to go watch a movie...all you want is something entertaining, not too artsy, or anything that might require a long night of philosophical discussions. So, you pay $10 to watch the Mod Squad. The trailer to this movie should have tipped me off, but come on...it&#39;s three of Hollywood&#39;s most beautiful people--eye candy. But that&#39;s about it...a string of moving Prada ads. And what did Hollywood producers forget? A plot. Why are these kids running around the streets after some unknown enemy? Where are they? But, don&#39;t worry, after a while, you&#39;ll just stop caring. I was on the verge of walking out of this movie, because I thought sitting in my room and staring at the wall might have been more productive (and free), but by that time, it was over (90 minutes--it&#39;s only saving grace). So, still willing to waste $10? Go, get yourself a nice hot meal.&#34;

b&#34;After seeing Forever Hollywood, it would be natural to want to see a John Waters film. At least, one get to say that they have joined the legions of cinema cognoscenti who have experienced the unique cinematic stylings of perhaps the best known non-mainstream director.

b&#39;Good lord! This movie needs to have a new classification on its cover &#34;watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to do!&#34;. I am disappointed. I was looking forward to a good horror movie over the weekend...needed an adrenalin rush and that awesome tingling sensation going down my spine. But this movie didn\&#39;t do it. A reasonably good story but pretty awful acting, dialogue, and filming. It was disjointed and sometimes outright silly. We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people talking out loud (by themselves) and narrating what they feel and what is going to happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, silly clich\xc3\xa9s like &#34;I just need you to hold me&#34; in the totally wrong places and situations.

b&#34;Its hard to decide where to begin.I bought this for a few quid and its the worst few quid Iv ever wasted. The back of the DVD had no pictures and a few lines plot summary, this should have warned me, but I usually like bad movies for a laugh so decided to give it a go. The movie is made up of three short stories,each revolving around someone who was on a particular bus at one point.(its never made clear what the significance of the bus is, or what city its set in)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSSIBLE SPOILERS(as if there is anything to be spoiled) The first story is about a man who is persuaded, by a car, to purcahse it, against his wife&#39;s wishes.The car is sort of like a demonic Brum and takes over his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second is about a slob of a man who never cleans his fridge and a monster bacteria man grows out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third about a woman who goes to a dating agency, only to discover her date isnt all that normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inbetween these, we are treated to shots of the bus(or A bus anyway) while a narrator whittles on a load of garbage about relationships(really,its like he is on commission for saying &#39;relationships&#39;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie actually has no redeeming features whatsoever.The acting, the costumes and the little Spfx are all disgusting.There arent even any attractive female cast members to admire.Simply put, this movie is a debacle.&#34;

b&#39;Ugh. This movie has so many unbelievable plot contrivances that they made what could have been a good movie into a hideous mess. The story is halfway decent, but the holes in the plot make the execution literally laughable. We\&#39;re actually supposed to believe that the Secret Service would go against all common sense and allow the President of the United States to be put at unbelievable risk. If this is an indication of the kind of thinking that passes for good judgment among the President\&#39;s protectors, then we\&#39;re all in trouble. Roy Scheider turns in a good performance as the President, but it is unfortunately offset by the truly loathsome acting of Patrick Muldoon (who somehow continues to get jobs in Hollywood based solely upon his good looks and his uncanny knack of smirking at every opportunity, regardless of whether the script calls for a smirk). Perhaps someone will see this and be inspired to make a good movie from the premise--or, perhaps someone will see it and say, &#34;Hey, if they can get a movie this bad made, maybe I can, too!&#34;&#39;

b&#39;The characters are annoying, immature, and flaky....Madison being the most annoying of all. OOH...a cold spot! Such a dire threat! Any ghost in that house would have fled in self-defense! To make a long story short, this movie is boring. Seeing a chair flying across a room may be creepy, but that\&#39;s about as intriguing as it gets. I watched it once and when one of my kids wanted to watch it again, I was tempted to take a baseball bat to the TV set rather than watch this rubbish again. If you want a good horror movie or even a passable comedy, this isn\&#39;t it! The only good part of the whole thing was &#34;the roach scene&#34; and, by the end of the movie, you ended up feeling sorry for the roach!&#39;

b&#34;After I couldn&#39;t ignore the hype about the show, I started watching season one and it struck me as really good and I was hooked.... for about 5 episodes, then it started to spiral downwards. Why? First, Ethan Suplee is scripted to act as a complete idiot confirming that very obviously by spewing out semi-random stuff in great expectations of it somehow becoming the next best joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jaime Pressly&#39;s got stunning looks, but if she thinks stretching lips to explore parts of the face to which they normally never go to and making strange grimaces to accentuate everything she says is hilarious, she&#39;s way off track. Maybe she thought her character would be too flat, faded and she wanted to make it colorful and spicy, but made a flood of colors, overkill of spices and screams out loud for attention and it hurts my eyes, ears and intellect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really, really wanted to love this show, like I said, the premise is great, (comes from the same shelf as The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain) and Jason Lee is doing a pretty good job here, along with some of the other actors but there is no way no how I would get &#39;sucked in&#39; and forget that this is just a show, because Pressly&#39;s and Suplee&#39;s surreal, extreme characters abruptly wake me when they show up. It&#39;s worth to note that their characters and acting would be fine if this wasn&#39;t a 70 something-part series and if they didn&#39;t get that much screen time.&#34;

b&#34;The Evil is about a big house where a bad spirit is foolishly unleashed to torture all inside. What a washout of a movie! There&#39;s not a single scary scene. Not one! Richard Crenna overplays a nothing role. There&#39;s some animated ghosts, a disfigurement by power saw, and a ghost-rape. After nothing special happens for almost the whole movie The Evil gets personified into...Victor Buono. Great! Where did the filmmakers get the idea that Buono is scary. He looks like he was on the bum for a guest starring paycheck to pay his liquor bill. By then its too late to turn it off, because the damn thing is over. I felt like throwing the videocassette out the window. Please avoid this junk! Hopefully it will never see the light of DVD and will fade into obscurity.&#34;

b&#39;Uninspired, pretty much all around. The only exceptions were a couple emotional scenes with Keena (Violet), with whose performance I was pleasantly surprised and occasionally moved. Beyond that, it ended up being little more than a bad COA flick.&#39;

b&#34;Worthless movie. A complete waste of time and nothing what I expected it to be. The packaging makes it seem as if it is of the American Pie genre (it isn&#39;t). rather it is a ridiculous stringing together of coincidences that makes the movie seem more like a writing exercise (let&#39;s try to see how many mix ups we can write in to make what should have been a bad SNL skit into a full length feature presentation). What is remarkable is that the director&#39;s (based on their commentary on the DVD) take themselves completely seriously. I have been a huge fan of the movies that National Lampoon lends its name to, up to and including Van Wilder. With this one, I feel completely cheated. In fact, I FEEL DUPED. I was expecting a Van Wilder like farce to relive my college days but instead was served an hour and a half of garbage. What lead to my ultimately unmet expectations? Well, for starters, the fact that the cast all appear naked (with an enormous sausage covering what must be covered) on the COVER of the DVD. Add to that the imagery on the back of the case as well as the description and you mislead people into thinking this is a movie that it is not. To make matters worse, the movie starts off as one might expect it too with half-naked drunk college students feebly trying a photo stunt, but ultimately this has nothing whatsoever to do with the movie. In fact, I didn&#39;t even realize that the people in that opening sequence where supposed to be the characters in the movie until I was told so by the directors in the commentary. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love plot twists and being surprised by movies, but I hate the fact that this movie tries to pawn itself off as something it is not. Ultimately, it does itself a huge disservice (artistically, though most likely not financially) because it sets its audience up for confusion and disappointment simply because it neglects to deliver what it advertises. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, do not rent this movie based on what you see on the case. It is not your usual National Lampoon movie. The only thing funny about it is the fact that many of the actors have appeared in other movies and TV shows that make their involvement here entertaining.&#34;

b&#39;A female ex-cop who was drummed out of the force for recklessness (and who could probably beat Chuck Norris in a fight) hires herself out as a private bodyguard; her first client is a worthless playboy type. It takes half the movie for her to get kicked off the force in the first place. Lots of great fight choreography but the plot is strictly by the numbers, and the acting is as wooden as the dialogue. Give this one a miss.&#39;

b&#39;Pretty dreadful movie about several unbalanced young people in a car starts off reasonably well but becomes more bizarre and hard to swallow as it progresses. Rachel Leigh Cook is the sole highlight in a tender and sexy performance, but I would recommend this film only to die-hard fans of the actress.&#39;

b&#34;This movie is such a piece of unbelievable crap. First let me talk about the pros: Sandra Bullock in a black bathing suit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the rest of the story which is all pretty much bad. We have said computer programmer Angela Bennett (who&#39;s online profile is ANGEL - HOW WITTY!!! I bet the directors cheered over that one for an hour) who basically checks other Company&#39;s software for errors/glitches etc. So we start with her ordering pizza on the Internet and then putting on a fireplace on her monitor (EXTREME computer skills shown thus far). This is after she finds some virus on a macintosh program which crashes the whole system after hitting the escape key. This is apparently a HUGE problem yet the virus created to do such could be done in about 1 minute with a simple batch file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any event, we move on. She gets this call from some other bloke (that works at the same company) and this fool says to go click this symbol which apparently opens up some secret Internet gateway to a bunch of unprotected &#39;top secret&#39; data woohoo! Angela saves this crap on a disc and now the people that created this loophole are out to get her. This of course is only after she hooks up with one of the bad guys only BEFORE he tries to kill her BEFORE she jumps in the ocean off his boat, BEFORE she winds up in a random hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem #1: You can&#39;t create a loophole on the Internet to gain access to a bunch of top secret FBI data. Where the hell did this come from? Since when can a group of hackers control the basic flow of the Internet (even in 95)? Problem #2: Angela would need proper identification before a hospital or clinic would release her. She could not just pack her things and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then these &#39;hackers&#39; or whatever change Angela&#39;s ID so she can&#39;t get help from anyone and conveniently enough all her ID is gone. So she returns home and a cat and mouse chase goes on and on and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently all police and FBI people are stupid and don&#39;t believe her. So then she has to utilize a bunch of tactics to enter into the building where she works (where the person who is now filling in for her is) and get back to her old computer. She starts talking to some other random bloke and finds out who is behind everything through some BS IP address that the director knows the audience is too stupid enough to believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she runs to some center to mail all this information to the FBI. She apparently HAS to use a mainframe to email stuff to the FBI. But then the same fool that tried to kill her BEFORE throwing her in the water catches her and easily hacks into the FBI again (wtf?). But remember that cool virus? Well somehow she luckily gets that and even though the virus only worked on software, it now works on the entire system too. It brings down the whole mainframe which has all the fake information because the mainframe was just sitting in the middle of some convention... WHAT THE HELL IS THIS CRAP! Anyway, the now uber virus works and Angela (the real one now) runs away and later kills the evil dude with a fire extinguisher. He of course has a gun, runs up to her so he&#39;s like 2 feet away and then decides to aim. CLASSIC Hollywood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this movie is so full of BS and crap. Anyone who doesn&#39;t know a lot about computers will be wildly fooled into thinking this crap is possible but not one thing is accurate concerning computers or the net. And I honestly doubt I&#39;d see a multiplatform virus for Mac and a mainframe computer (*cough LMAO*).&#34;

b&#34;This movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible. The plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny and pretentious that by the end I wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I don&#39;t write reviews, but I was astonished by the number of positive reviews it got. While I admit that the acting was okay at some parts, the script&#39;s deficiencies more than outweighed the decent acting. The only reason I watched this was because a few of my friends were watching it, introducing it as most likely the worst movie ever made, judging by the trailer. We were not disappointed in the least. Its only saving grace is that it contained my new favorite pickup line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRANDON: I just want to get to know you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GIRL: You just want to get into my pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRANDON: I want to get into your mind, your heart, your soul. I don&#39;t see you wearing any pants in this equation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would rate this movie as the worst movie I ever saw that took itself seriously.&#34;

b&#34;CRYSTAL VOYAGER is a strange documentary about an eccentric surfer living in Australia. An American by birth George Greenough has surfed and photographed himself, friends and recently, dolphins, in Australia for 35 years, all using various re invented cameras which he either straps on his back, board or boat. In the mid 70s he teamed up with Surf Mag editor and budding film maker David Elfick to create this visually interesting tale about this life and photography. The 75 minute feature CRYSTAL VOYAGER is the result. Even in the 70s audiences were a bit puzzled by this film, neither surf-ing movie nor surf movie, because George swims about on a children&#39;s zippy board, not a real surfboard.... it offset the tedious droning of George (occasionally so dry or droll that it was actually funny.. like almost setting himself on fire or falling over something) with a spectacular &#39;you are there&#39; power glide through a wave that ran for 23 minutes all set to Pink Floyd music. In 1974 when the Sydney Opera house opened, it also contained a cinema. Crystal Voyager was booked in there as an arty-sporty OZ pic and by default became a hit: as the &#39;opera house tickets&#39; cost far more than a movie ticket, audiences flocked to see this film as an excuse to &#39;have been to the Sydney Opera House&#39;...so the film did record business as a low budget attraction to locals and tourists who wanted to tell neighbors that they had seen a show &#39;there&#39;. This created this myth that the film was a huge crowd puller and the reputation spread. As a result it was teamed with the fantasy cartoon FANTASTIC PLANET and had a trippy run through the UK and Europe as a double feature. I ran it at a coastal cinema in the 70s and the crowd was rather nonplussed about it all. Recently George has re emerged Lord Of The Flies style with another well photographed sea adventure called DOLPHIN GLIDE that offers viewers a dive and swim with the wild dolphins of Byron Bay. It is an eccentric 20 min short with an even more eccentric 20 min &#39;how George did it&#39; short. Each were met with a collective yawn by both the media and the pubic in January 2005.... all of which makes CRYSTAL VOYAGER a &#39;you had to have been there&#39; fluke all those years ago. However at a special Oz Surf night at an outdoor cinema last year 2000 people turned up....but then 2000 turn up every night to see anything there during this summer season of films.....so the damned thing fluked another box office binge. How many actually enjoyed it is very much open to debate. Again they were more than likely just plain puzzled by this mad film with an astonishing reputation. Elfick however, since 1975, has gone onto a stellar career as a major producer and director of many lauded Australian and international films. Look up NO WORRIES or STARSTRUCK or UNDERCOVER or RABBIT PROOF FENCE or LOVE IN LIMBO for clear and present applause at his achievements. George, however, is still floating around out there somewhere droning away and looking for something else to film, or drop a camera on.&#34;

b&#39;Imagine this: a high school. Except it\&#39;s boarding school, and the kids don\&#39;t have parents around. Oh, and it\&#39;s in Malibu. And the kids are all thin, white, and gorgeous, with the exceptional token minority or fat kid to play the &#34;weird&#34; outcast. And there aren\&#39;t any reasonable rules, like how they have co-habitation, nuclear weapons in their dorms, coffee stands, a sushi bar, and a complimentary laptop per student.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here\&#39;s the story: A girl, Zoey Brooks, attends PCA, a formerly all-boys school. Absolutely perfect in every possible way, she is smart, pretty, thin, athletic, creative, and everything a perfectionist wants to be. Almost all the boys in school want her, and every girl wants to be her friend. She\&#39;s the one everyone comes to for advice, the one who saves the day with a simplistic plan, and is just wonderful. Too bad none of this makes her likable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are we supposed to believe that if we don\&#39;t even come close to Zoey\&#39;s perfection, we\&#39;re bad people? In the show, nothing\&#39;s her fault, and if anyone contradicts her, they\&#39;re portrayed as the bad guy(Logan). He may be a jerk, but at least he has some kind of brain that thinks for himself instead of simply agreeing with the princess every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her loyal group of blind followers are: Chase, the average dumb ass that has a secret crush on her, Michael, the token black guy (and the only decent actor on the set), Lola, a wannabe actress and anorexic, snobby airhead, Quinn, the smart but clueless girl when it comes to teen stuff, and Logan, the rich jerk who has a soft side. Yeah, this show basically spews out stereotypes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What ticks me off, though, is that they all try to pretend they\&#39;re normal kids. They complain that Logan gets too much money while they have to work themselves, even though they already go to a too-good-to-be-true boarding school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers can\&#39;t afford. They drink coffee and eat sushi on a regular basis, hardly have homework, and suntan almost every day. Wow, they have it hard! Any other problems? I\&#39;m too good-looking, rich, and stress-free! I guess Zoey 101 (what\&#39;s the 101 for, anyway?) is Nick\&#39;s attempt at trying to portray teens realistically. Except they caught a glimpse of reality, didn\&#39;t like it, and decided to give the kids lives like the asses on The Hills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey, at least the set\&#39;s pretty.&#39;

b&#39;This was one of the most dishonest, meaningless, and non-peaceful of the films I have ever seen. The representation of the other, of the Israelis, was racist, backward, and unfair. For one, the song played on E.S\&#39; car radio when pulled up alongside a very right-wing Israeli driver was &#34;I put a spell on you&#34; by Natacha Atlas. The song\&#39;s style is quite Arabic, but it was released on an Israeli compilation CD, and I have even heard it on the radio in Israel. Many Israeli songs (as well as architecture, foods, and slang) are influenced by Arabic culture, and there is no reason an Israeli Jew would be offended or angered by a nearby car playing that song. The way E.S. appears so calm and collected with his sunglasses and cool glare, via a long, still shot, is meant to force the viewer into seeing the Jew as haggard and racist, and E.S. as noble and temperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have traveled all over Israel, and I have never seen an IDF recruitment poster, since service is mandatory. But in the film, not only is there a recruitment poster, but it depicts a stereotypical image of an Arab terrorist and the words &#34;want to shoot?&#34; This is an extremely inaccurate depiction of the mentality of the majority of Israelis as well as Israeli soldiers, and such an &#34;advertisement&#34; wouldn\&#39;t even exist on a random Israeli highway. In including it, the director aims to convince the audience that Israel is a society of anti-Arab racists hell-bent on murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ninja scene was gratuitous and needlessly violent. A Hollywood-style action scene involving Israeli soldiers shooting Palestinians would be just as unwelcome in an Israeli-directed film as the ninja scene should have been. But for some reason, images of an unrealistic, non-comic, and violent scenario manage to elicit applause from the audience since the director has smeared the Israeli side so much beforehand, that any shot of Israeli soldiers being killed would be welcome. The director shows absolutely no attempt at building bridges, portraying the &#34;other&#34; as human, or working towards peace; violence is made to be the only solution. This is furthered by scenes of exploding tanks, falling guard towers, and other random acts of destruction. One of my best friends serves in the Israeli military, and the targets in firing ranges are never Arab women dressed in black, or any other quasi-civilian on canvas. Soldiers at checkpoints are instructed not to fire at the head of an approaching Palestinian unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger; the method, according to my friend, is to provide a warning shout, fire into the air or around the area, and then if all else fails, shoot in the leg and then interrogate and hospitalize. Arbitrarily targeting a woman in the head, as shown in the film, is not the proper procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides these inaccuracies, the directing style was also poor. Repetition became repetitious, and no longer captivating. Symbols, such as the balloon with Arafat drawn on it, are forced outside any plot structure or effective integration in the setting; the balloon is Palestine penetrating and regaining Jerusalem, and it is created for no reason by E.S. The ambulance being checked for permits by Israeli soldiers followed by subsequent Israeli ambulances flying past the checkpoint is an overly-overt claim of an Israeli double standard by the director. The attempt by the director to show life in Nazareth as dreary and pointless is done with overkill; showing the routines of random people over and over again, even with a slight change each time, and emphasizing that not one member of the cast ever smiles and is minimalist in dialogue almost screams out the purpose of such scenes, the dreariness of life, without allowing much room for personal interpretation. By contrasting one &#34;section&#34; of the movie, daily life in Nazareth, with the second section, the checkpoint between Ramallah and Israel, the director subtly blames this dreariness on Israel, but never provides any direct evidence as to why such blame can be properly argued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent hours trying to figure out why music ended abruptly and began abruptly, and why many modern fashion-show-like and metal-action tracks were included in the score. I still cannot come up with an answer. I felt that the music was out of place in this film; the contrast between more silent scenes and intense scenes was actually annoying and not affecting or thought-provoking. I can understand if the director intended for the music to provide some comic aspect to certain scenes, but I found that there was nothing comic to be found in Israeli soldiers shooting at targets or fighting a ninja, or a woman having to suffer another walk through a checkpoint, albeit defiantly. In fact, I was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes, and annoyed by the lack of a score during quiet scenes. Whatever the director\&#39;s intent, it provided only an audial displeasure throughout the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film has no legitimate political message because it provides an inaccurate and extreme representation of the other, and neglects to actually address any issues. It is a propaganda film, because the director intends various symbols, styles, and scenes to draw sympathy for the Palestinian side, while displaying the Israeli side as cruel and inhuman without exception; the vibrant atmosphere of an action-packed Hollywood scene or of intense music is displayed in every act of violence by Palestinians against Israelis, such that the almost inevitably positive and thrilled feelings the music and cinematography elicit from the audience are directed to one side. There is no thought, reflection, or deepening of the understanding of the conflict by the audience; emotions are simply pulled to one side, and kept there, in a &#34;good vs bad&#34; clich\xc3\xa9 scenario. I believe this film lacked the depth, quality, and power of other Palestinian films, such as &#34;Paradise Now&#34; and &#34;Wedding in the Galilee.&#34;&#39;

b&#34;Having read this story a while ago I was very excited to see the movie. I read the book again. It is one of my favorite Nicholas Sparks books. What I think what makes the story is the relationships. That was the down point for me in the movie because I think the relationships were poorly expressed in the movie. I have no idea what the point of changing main characters roles (Tim&#39;s and Alan&#39;s characters). The movie didn&#39;t at all capture John and Savannah&#39;s relationship. Maybe if you haven&#39;t read the book you might like this movie, but I thought it was so dull compared to the book. I thought Channing was a great pick for John,but I had a feeling he was going to bring all young adults out to watch it, so I think it was more geared towards them. The ending cuts the whole point of the book out so I was also unhappy with that. I was hoping the movie was more like the notebook or a walk to remember and the way they captured the books. I do feel like I wasted a Friday night out and 10 bucks on a sappy love story, not at all the story I was expecting to see.&#34;

b&#39;Although the figures are higher in proportion to other areas of society, I don\&#39;t object to the extremely high salaries for many of today\&#39;s entertainers and athletes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A-Rod, LeBron or Brady all have deals either well with 8 figures, or the low-9 area. Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld could actually become billionaires from their shows, huge residuals and fees they currently demand. Even their cast members, and all of the &#34;Friends&#34; group reached near or over 7 figures per episode. Letterman\&#39;s earnings for one show could solve most people\&#39;s financial problems, and a week or two\&#39;s take care of many for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all of these are based upon sound supply/demand principals, and the financial benefits they bring to their employers. And all perform their crafts ably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then comes along someone like Rachel Ray, who reaches a level of earnings far beyond any apparent level of talent or skill. I find her shrill, annoying, and with a forced &#34;perkiness&#34; that\&#39;s as phony as the proverbial &#34;3-dollar bill.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine is responsible for special meetings, events and convention plans for her firm and its affiliates. One of the major talent sources has hundreds of clients available from the $5-10K level, to a handful who get $200K and up per appearance. (This area includes Trump, Seinfeld, Lance Armstrong, Robin Williams, and, no kidding, Larry the Cable Guy.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a greater number in the $100,001 - 200,000 range; list included the likes of Bill Cosby, Steve Martin and even cable guy Larry\&#39;s benefactor, Jeff Foxworthy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This category includes Rachael Ray. I suppose I have to admit there may be sufficient demand for her &#34;talent&#34; and offerings to justify her talk show and there may be some out there who\&#39;ll pay more than $100K, + first class air, hotel suite, all expenses and limos door-to-door, for just a couple of hours of her whiny prattle at their organization\&#39;s event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can\&#39;t figure how-in-the-hell this could be possible.&#39;

b&#34;This film is about a mysterious love letter that turned 4 people&#39;s love life upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of the film is interesting, and the film could have been funny. However, this film is simply what a romantic comedy should not be. The characters are inadequately introduced at first, so it gets so confusing. The supporting characters come and go without adequate reasons, as if they exist just for one particular scene and then vanish into thin air. The pacing is awfully slow, that it makes 90 minutes seem more like 180 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could have been romantic and funny, but this film spectacularly failed to do either.&#34;

b&#39;4 realz son my game iz mad tite yo I cant wait 2 get on dis show and roll up in da club n do it real 905 style wit mad models n bottles, son!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I\&#39;m just kidding. This is a sad show, created by, and for the enjoyment of, sad men. Men who are so neutered by modern existence that they channel their frustration into the clubs, where they eke out fleeting self-validation preying on chicks in hopes of getting their little wieners touched to try and dull the sting of loneliness and make them feel, even if just for one night, as though their seat on the Board of the Sausage Party of Toronto is a little less permanent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some comments on here saying that this show represents Canadian TV\&#39;s finally stepping up to stand on a par with American TV or somethingorother. Well, that\&#39;s not aiming short at all. It\&#39;s like, Yes! Pat yourself on the back, Canada -- you\&#39;ve finally cracked the elusive formula for such groundbreaking American content as &#34;Studs&#34;, &#34;Change of Heart&#34;, &#34;Elimidate&#34; and &#34;The Fifth Wheel&#34;. See, the real brainchild here is tacking &#34;...meets Candid Camera&#34; onto the pitch. Genius. And there\&#39;s nothing that straddles that thin line between fratboy camaraderie and latent homosexuality like a group of grown men taping each other on hidden camera, admiring each other\&#39;s &#34;game&#34; up in the club. The man-love on display here is so palpable they should really consider rechristening it &#34;Keys to the Steam Bath&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, how interesting that the folks who gave this show such glowing reviews seem to have registered an IMDb account for the express purpose of doing so (I guess I\&#39;m guilty of employing the same means to do the opposite here.) My personal favorite is the one enthusiastic reviewer that claims to hail from the &#34;United States&#34; who gushes that &#34;Now it\&#39;s clear that the talent in Canada has the ability to produce American quality television.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But why even bother manufacturing online buzz? You can\&#39;t really get cancelled, after all -- you\&#39;re on the Comedy Network in Canada, baby! The viewing public will go on ignoring your show for years to come. In all likelihood you\&#39;ll be just fine, coasting comfortably along that proverbial plain of mediocrity with the majority of the Comedy Network\&#39;s original programming.&#39;

b&#34;This movie is really bad. Most of it looks like it was filmed either in a park or a basement. There&#39;s a giant spider but all we see of it is one leg. There are some worms that live in a cave that are just cheap sock puppets with cardboard teeth. And the plot is a bunch of post-apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that makes no sense at all.

b&#39;This movie is the worst thing ever created by humans. You think manos is the worst movie ever? It doesn\&#39;t even come close to this garbage. I dont even know where to begin. The &#34;russian&#34; commander and the rebel chic are the worst &#34;actors&#34; ever to appear in a movie. They make the sister in troll 2 look like Meryl Streep. The goofy faces the chic makes while she\&#39;s in kung fu training have to be seen to be believed. Then there is the oompa music during the prison break, the totally out of place love scene, the stupid song that plays during the out of place love scene, the fake castro, the fact that everybody has either a headband and/or a bandanna on some part of their body, the goofiest rape scene ever filmed, and the worst acting ever put on film. This movie deserves to be more well known among bad movie fans. Definitely the worst movie ever made.&#39;

b&#34;I rented this movie, knowing that it would be bad (i have only seen one good Disney sequel and that was toy story 2), but it went far lower than my expectations. I am a die hard disney fan and i just don&#39;t believe in sequels with disney movies. For somebody who didn&#39;t grow up with the classics (either watching them when they came out, or renting them since you were born) it&#39;s a cute story. I just feel that the plot was dragged out a little too much, and was to predictable. The one thing that annoyed me the most was the voices of the girl children of lady and tramp. They were too high pitched. Although most reviews say that it isn&#39;t that bad, i think that if you are a true disney fan, you shouldn&#39;t waste your time with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully Disney won&#39;t be making any more sequels to any of the other classics any time soon.&#34;

b&#39;I couldn\&#39;t even...I mean...look....okay...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even a bunch of my drunk friends trying to make fun of the movie could enjoy themselves in the least bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only think...how. How do independent film makers everywhere go years without getting noticed (or even their lives) and con-artists like the guy who made this get a DVD on a shelf? It seriously looks as if some guy with a home movie camera went out with some guys he met at Subway and made the worst thing he could think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Hey guys, give me some ideas. Start with a corn-field and work backwards.&#34; &#34;Well, you\&#39;ve gotta have actors straight out of high school, and some broken corn stalks with shreds of clothing attached. And boobs.&#34; Thanks, guy, I\&#39;m sure that you and Windows Movie Maker will be side by side on your next anxiously awaited project.&#39;

b&#34;In a way, you have to respect Arachnia. It&#39;s clearly meant as a tribute to the big bug movies of the fifties, and while the special effects look terrible; at least the film doesn&#39;t feature CGI. However, on the other hand; you can&#39;t respect the film too much because it&#39;s a load of rubbish. The acting is terrible, the special effects (as mentioned) are impossible to take seriously, and once you&#39;ve seen one giant spider being blown up; you&#39;ve seen them all, so it gets boring rather quickly. The plot follows a bunch of people who are unlucky enough to be in a plane crash after a meteor shower. They go to the only house in the area; which just happens to be a house where a man has a huge spider he used to use as a circus attraction. Coincidently around the same time, the meteor shower has caused more giant spiders to rise from underground. All the characters in this film are poor caricatures; none of them have anything even resembling a third dimension and they will soon begin to thoroughly bore you. You&#39;ve got to feel for director Brett Piper as he clearly didn&#39;t have much to work with for this film; but that doesn&#39;t make Arachnia worth a damn, and overall there are better giant bug films than this, and therefore Arachnia doesn&#39;t get the seal of approval from me.&#34;

b&#39;The main portion of this lightweight musical story is located at fictional Midwick College, which Peter Kendricks (Peter Lind Hayes) attends due to the largesse of stage actress Grace Hayes, his real-life mother who fills the same role here, and who manages to supply his love interest through her secretary Mary (Healy) who is his real-life wife. Drably directed from a weak script, and additionally hampered by excessive cutting and poor editing, this film does provide some treasures among its eight songs, including the title number, and has nice turns by soprano Healy, Benny Rubin as a snack shop proprietor, and the dynamic tap dancing Roland Dupree.&#39;

b&#39;Jack Frost 2. THE worst &#34;horror film&#34; I have ever seen. Why? 1)The premise is WELL beyond ridiculous 2) The damn thing doesn\&#39;t even have legs to move on! 3) It escapes AFTER being completely submerged in Anti-Freeze (first film) 4) Get this...It travels all the way across an ocean of SALT WATER to a TROPICAL island to get revenge on the sheriff that did him in the first film. 5) &#34;Killer Snowballs&#34;. I have yet to be drunk enough to see &#34;Ginger Dead Man&#34; so as of the writing of this, Jack Frost 2 hold the distinction of being THE stupidest &#34;horror&#34; film ever. Even Surpassing the inaneness of it\&#39;s predecessor (if you can believe that!).&#39;

b&#39;The film begins in Latvia just after WWI. Being a history teacher, I knew that multinational troops occupied much of Russia during this time. There was serious concern about the spread of Bolshevism and the troops were there ostensibly to protect their nations\&#39; interests. However, some times they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the Communist army, as the nations involved really wanted to see the so-called &#34;Whites&#34; win. However, the Whites were deeply factionalized--some wanting the return of a czar, some wanting a republic and some wanting something in between. Because of these mixed goals and a lack of a real commitment by the foreign armies, the whole expedition was doomed and left the USSR after only a year or two. However, what I did NOT know was that German troops were also involved. This surprised me, as they had just lost WWI and weren\&#39;t in the best shape to be mounting such an expedition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the backdrop for the film, but it\&#39;s also about a pro-Communist rich lady and her ill-fated love for a childhood friend who is among the German troops. She throws herself at him repeatedly but in each case he rebuffs her. So, she then sublimates these desires by various affairs. While none of this sex is all that graphic, this and the underlying reason the man isn\&#39;t interested make this a rather adult film and one I wouldn\&#39;t show to younger audiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the setting for this film is interesting, the overall film is as gray and lifeless as any I have seen. I don\&#39;t recommend it unless you are an amazingly patient person or you are really into overrated German films. I especially warn away anyone who suffers with depression, as it will no doubt make it worse. The simple fact is that there are so many better German films out there waiting to be seen--such as MOSTLY MARTHA, DAS BOOT, MOTHER KUSTERS GOES TO HEAVEN, WINGS OF DESIRE or ALI, FEAR EATS THE SOUL (among others).&#39;

b&#39;This film was nothing more than exploitative gay cheesecake. It was not an &#34;art&#34; movie; just an excuse to show several gratuitous, exploitative, over-the-top scenes with extensive male genital nudity. There was a locker room scene involving over a dozen naked men. The camera zooms in on the men\&#39;s asses and penises as they are portrayed for several minutes with their dicks in full screen view. There are several scenes in this film showing penis after penis. It gets redundant REAL fast and makes it impossible to take this film seriously. I was wondering if I was watching a Playgirl video by mistake. If these same scenes were filmed using women (ex: totally naked and showing their vaginas repeatedly) it would be quickly dismissed as just softcore porn and an excuse to show a lot of eye candy...which is all that this film is. Any artistic merit got flushed down the drain of the gay ghetto mentality. The themes of class distinction, homosexuality, longing-desire, etc. were simple and superficial; no more developed than what one would expect from a first year philosophy student. Just cut to the chase and rent a gay porn instead.&#39;

b&#34;This is a poorly written and badly directed short film, pure and simple. What is interesting and keep me watching, to some extent, was the production values. Shot on video it appears, with a bad script and bad direction, one would think it would also have horrible production value. That is what the viewer expects when they watch a film that is terrible and shot on video. BUT Not in this case, they spent some money and it shows. It keep me very mildly interested to see what was coming next, just to see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the worst short film I have seen that looked big budget hollywood even though it was shot on some sort of video format.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of spending the sum of money they must have spent for some rather impressive set design, it would have been nicer to see a better executed story with some good direction. But then again how can we expect new filmmakers to do this when even hollywood won&#39;t.&#34;

b&#34;Fame did something odd. It was not only a musical that was created originally for the screen (most are based off of Broadway musicals), but it spawned a TV series and a Broadway musical. Let me correct that sentence. Fame is not a musical. Musicals have song numbers in order to advance the plot or to show characters&#39; feelings. The singing in this music is not used to do either; in fact, there&#39;s no use for it at all. People just randomly sing to fit in with the plot. And that&#39;s not the type of musical I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The so-called plot of Fame has an onslaught of characters (who are all introduced at once-last time I saw that in a movie [Gosford Park] it had disastrous results) who audition for, and get into, New York High School for the Performing Arts. All of them are in for different reasons-i.e. acting, singing, etc. Quote-unquote drama unfolds as these middle-aged people pretending to be teenagers go through their four years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My largest complaint is that the high school is supposed to be selective. After all, it&#39;s a free college, and they can&#39;t let everyone in. So how is it that some people who are really bad get into the college? Obviously so that drama could ensue between all of these different people. And why is the person top billed not even in the movie until near the end, for no reason at all, except to make us feel uncomfortable? There&#39;s many unsettling situations that these untalented people get into, yet you can&#39;t feel bad for them because you don&#39;t know who they are! These relationships occur between people whose names you don&#39;t know. And these characters realize things about themselves throughout the course of the movie, yet you don&#39;t realize that, because you don&#39;t know what they were like in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the singing, it pops in randomly (and is supposed to be humorous?) and does nothing. When the title song is sung, it&#39;s played in the middle of a street and before you can say Ferris Bueller everyone&#39;s in the middle of the street dancing wildly and off-beat to it. The song itself is fine, but the whole scene, like the whole movie, is unnecessary. Fame is an unpleasant movie, to say the least. I would say more, but most of the movie has thankfully gone out of my head. Just don&#39;t see it. You&#39;ll be doing yourself a favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My rating: 2/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rated R for language.&#34;

b&#34;An object lesson in how to make a bad movie which masquerades as Horror. Without going in too close I would imagine this is the results of a bunch of film school students all adding bits to the story and then actually ACTING in it! Its like a film workshop of some kind and its a film badly in need of an editor-in which case it would have lasted 10 minutes! The director of this garbage probably had more money than sense. Consider the number of submitted scripts or even unreleased films which would have benefited from this. The so called Granny who was killing people in some pretty stupid ways looked like Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future-or maybe the musicians Johnny Winter/Edgar Winter. It starts off with 20 minutes of crass boring nonsense spouted out by the students-something about paranoia. Giving this rubbish 1 is because it can&#39;t get any less. It has not one single redeeming feature-and when one of the girls thinks the body on the floor covered in blood is the guy fooling about she has to actually TASTE the red stuff before she knows its not tomato ketchup! Its an insult to the intelligence of an idiot&#34;

b&#34;I simply cannot understand how any Who fan, or just plain anyone could find this awful, lazy, poorly written abomination even remotely funny. It is so embarrassingly below par that it qualifies as a genuine tragedy. The potential for this was huge, it could have been great. What a shame that all that acting talent, the sets, the props, the goodwill of everyone involved was so pathetically wasted by a script that should have been burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an obvious lack of any rigorous production and quality control here. Like those hammy Hollywood movies (mad mad mad world, casino royale) where the stars are just mugging for each other and &#39;having a great time&#39; which basically means picking up a cheque for doing nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could have written a better Who send-up in my sleep. In fact I have, while awake though. I did it in Year 10 in high school and performed it with a bunch of classmates. It was better, I look at it now and the gags are funnier. Steven Moffat YOU ARE A NO TALENT BUM! What a waste, what a wasted opportunity. Makes me want to cry....&#34;

b&#39;First of all. Should Cameron Diaz ever be allowed to act again? To call that a bad performance would be an insult to bad performances. That was a historically horrific performance. Any small chance that Diaz had at being a serious actress is now completely done after that. Laughably horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two, the movie was extremely boring, and not very thought provoking at all. I can sit around and ponder human nature without having to watch terrible actors, play out a terrible story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, there was not a single likable character, and even worse, it seemed like that was done by design. You were not supposed to like, or feel sympathy for any character. It was quite effective. I wanted them all to just die to be honest. Aliens included. Kid included. Everyone was just one big mope in this movie. Everyone literally just moped around, and they called it a movie. You could barely distinguish the zombie &#34;employees,&#34; with regular people, because they all seemed like zombies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, nothing really makes sense. From the characters reactions and emotions, to the literal story line, it all just seems random. This is just a really bad movie, disguised and couched as a &#34;thinking mans movie,&#34; which is meant to be confusing. Give me a break. A bad movie is a bad movie. And this movie was bad.&#39;

b&#34;Written by, directed by and starring the champ of camp Bruce Campbell. Easy on its easy to tell this is a budget on a shoestring affair; filmed independently in Bulgaria. All I can really say for sure is that silly is not always funny. Campbell plays an affluent American business man with a cheating wife(Antoinette Byron)and trying to close a business transaction before he is murdered. He hires a cabbie to drive him around a strange little town; not knowing that his wife is &#39;carrying on&#39; with the taxi driver. Within moments of Campbell being bludgeoned; the cabbie is killed in the same location. A mad scientist(Stacy Keach)proceeds with an experiment putting the cabbie&#39;s brain inside the American&#39;s head. With massive stitches on his forehead, Campbell breaks free and roams the streets looking for his wife; all the while he is arguing with a strange voice inside his over-sized head. Campbell contorts his rubbery face making silly expressions as he argues with himself. Thus, Bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be pleased. I get the impression this must have been written as a straight comedy. Rounding out the cast are Ted Raimi, Tamara Gorski, and Vladmir Kolev. Watch for this on the Sci-Fi Channel.&#34;

b&#34;I&#39;d liked the Takashi Miike films I&#39;d seen so far, but I found this pretty disappointing. I&#39;d bought it, but I won&#39;t be keeping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw it on the Adness DVD, which has just two episodes. In the first, a killer abducts women, cuts the top of their skull off to expose the brain, plants them in the ground up to their chin, and plants a flower in the brain. You can tell that from the DVD box. In the movie, the top of the head is digitally blurred out by TV static. Had you not seen the DVD box, the viewer wouldn&#39;t know what people were looking at until later a young cop produced a small model of the body. Oddly, there is also a flash frame later on of the woman&#39;s head and it is not censored. Apart from this, I&#39;m not really sure what was going on. Some women get phone calls, and a sketchy animated character cavorts around when that happens. An animated character also appears on TV screens sometimes. It&#39;s unclear if anybody sees it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the second episode, pregnant women are being found cut open and their babies are missing. Again, a cop produces a model of what the corpses are like, which is helpful since again the actual body is censored. There is also a natural birth in the movie, but oddly even that baby and the umbilical cord are censored! According the the DVD box, uncensored versions were not kept when this was originally made. Perhaps even if they had, if they knew they were going to be censored, maybe they didn&#39;t bother actually showing anything...? Not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I hear the later episodes are better, maybe I&#39;ll look for them. As it is, I won&#39;t bother.&#34;

b&#34;Frank Falenczyk: It isn&#39;t that I&#39;m sorry I killed them; it&#39;s that I&#39;m sorry I killed them badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! Talk about a swing and a miss. You have a great cast and a great plot with endless possibilties...how do you f_ck that up?! Well, apparently John Dahl has found a way. With an atrocious screenplay featuring jokes about as funny as a malaria epidemic and dialogue so painfully dry it makes none of the characters likable, &#39;You Kill Me&#39; might be the biggest cinematic failure of 2007. On a positive note, Ben Kinglsey provides another great performance as the alcoholic Polish hit man trying to get clean but the material he has to work with is crap. Tea Leoni is good as well as is Luke Wilson, Dennis Farina, Bill Pullman, Philip Baker Hall and the rest of the cast. I guess the best way to describe &#39;You Kill Me&#39; is a terrible movie with good performances. Grade: D+&#34;

b&#34;What a dreadful movie. The effects were poor, especially by todays standards, but that was forgivable. What was unforgivable was the terrible rehashing of every flood/dam breaks disaster movie ever made into this piece of trash. The acting was awful and I mean AWFUL. The point in the story where Michelle Green stops to rescue a dog from the approaching torrent was hilarious. They see the water approaching and run for their lives. (By the way they had to find a very old fat dog so as to not make Ms Green look to unfit). They manage to outpace the water for some time before taking refuge. What speed! Later, a speeding car is not fast enough to escape the torrent. God, she and that dog did run fast! If you want to watch a good movie about a dam breaking - this isn&#39;t it. Porchlight Entertainment turn out some good family films but this time they just missed the mark.&#34;

b&#39;Am I the only one who thought the point of this film was the graphic violence? I knew nothing about Leigh Scott when I rented it, and would not have done so if I had known that most of his previous films were horror films. I am not into that at all, I was just expecting an informative docudrama of the 9/11 report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I got an almost incomprehensible, violent movie. The only good thing about it for me, was that it made me want to read the report, to figure out what the heck this movie was about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this because I am shocked that we have become so immune to violence in films and on TV, that it was not even worth commenting on by the bloggers whose reviews that I read.&#39;

b&#34;I have now seen quite a few films by Pedro Almod\xc3\xb3var, but this would have to be the most disappointing so far. This film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films, and the story just never got me interested. Many Almod\xc3\xb3var regulars appear in this film, so it&#39;s not like there was a lack of on-screen talent, but this film just seemed more serious than his other films. If there was a comedic edge to this movie, I certainly couldn&#39;t find it, and it made for one surprisingly weak movie.&#34;

b&#39;This very loose retelling of Carmen begins on a high note with a smoldering, sexually-frank dance between Senaglese prisoner &#34;Karmen&#34; and her female prison warden, but the vibrant opening minutes never ignite into any coherent film. One minute Karmen is all sexual predator, the next she is dancing in protest to her unfair government, and then suddenly she is a smuggler on the high seas... Although the film deserves kudos for postulating the first carnivorously bisexual &#34;Karmen,&#34; the broad strokes it paints are so vignette-like and unsupported by any narrative coherence that the film comes off as a schizophrenic, undisciplined melange of &#34;Basic-Instinct&#34; meets &#34;Bound&#34; meets an African version of a Bollywood musical.&#39;

b&#34;I&#39;ve got to say, I&#39;m a big fan of these &#39;Last House on the Left&#39; rip-offs, even the ones that most people seem to hate are often held in relatively high esteem by me; but one of these sorts of films that I didn&#39;t like much was Aldo Lado&#39;s &#39;Night Train Murders&#39;, and unfortunately it would seem that trains and The Last House on the Left don&#39;t mix, as Terror Express is another lacklustre rip-off. Something that this sort of film really needs is a resoundingly nasty lead character; and while Terror Express offers up three potential candidates, not one of them steps up and becomes this villain, leaving the lacking in the most important area. It actually gets off to a good start as three young men on a passenger train begin slightly irritating the guests on board. This leads the audience to believe that there is more in store, but unfortunately it never really gets going once the scene has been set. From there, the trio end up &#39;taking over&#39; the train and use their new found power to terrorise the guests and rape the women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has to be said that there&#39;s a fair amount of sleaze in this film, which will be pleasing to many viewers; but there&#39;s hardly any blood. Director Ferdinando Baldi seemed to think that he could get away with replacing the blood with sex scenes, and he may have gotten away with it too; if he could film a brutal sex scene. The idea that these men have taken the train by force goes out of the window once it gets to the sex, as the people that you would expect to be powerful and forceful seem all too keen to show their women a good time, and despite one very tame &#39;sandwich&#39; sequence, none of the sex is particularly interesting. Since a lot of the film is taken up by these sex scenes, this becomes a massive problem. Films like this are often lacking in style, suspense and credibility; but you know you&#39;re watching a bad one when it&#39;s boring you. As you might expect, none of the acting is up to anything; and the central three in particular stand out for being rubbish. The direction is lacking in style, and there&#39;s very little tension or suspense; making it difficult to care what is going to happen. Overall, this is a pretty crappy example of an exploitation film, and I can&#39;t recommend it.&#34;

b&#34;This film is an almost complete waste of time. I am studying the book for my English A level, and the film only contributes in one way, and that&#39;s getting across that the whole scenario is set in a rural idyll. The acting is wooden, the filmography is laughable, and the so called dramatic scenes in the film had the majority of my class (including me) snickering into their texts. The book, although not my favourite literary choice, is miles better than the film is, and the sound track is just plain irritating. Don&#39;t watch this film unless you are looking for a timeless, quality storyline transformed into mindless, media waste.&#34;

b&#39;Let me preface by stating that I have lived in Louisville, Kentucky all of my life. I grew up about \xc2\xbd mile from Waverly. In the wintertime we would pull our sleds down Maryman road and cross Dixie Highway to go sleigh riding on Waverly Hill. Many times during the winter of 76-77 we would climb into the Tunnel to warm ourselves. The place was still being run as a &#34;Geriatric Center&#34; at the time. We would go all the way through the tunnel up the hill to bang on what we thought was the &#34;Door to the Morgue&#34;. I have to be honest. The only sensation we felt was that we were getting away with something we should not be doing. I would have to say we went up that tunnel over 50 times that winter. Nothing stranger than teen-aged boys acting stupid ever happened. I love the fact that it is getting attention after all these years. One evening when I was young we looked out our front porch and it appeared that the entire hill was on fire. There was an older hospital on the hill that burned down. It burned for hours while the entire neighborhood sat outside and watched. The thing that gets lost about Waverly is that many people survived TB there. Let\&#39;s face it\xc2\x85The doctors back then did everything they thought was correct to save people. It took a lot of guts for people to work there knowing how contagious TB was. Too much is focused on those who suffered. I also have traveled into the building several times in the early 70\&#39;s. We would go and visit shut-ins in the Nursing Home through a church youth group. By the way, the doors there were not prison like steel doors with chains and padlocks as portrayed in the film. They were wooden and open\xc2\x85sometimes too open. It did smell of urine and feces and you saw the occasional open gown associated with patients with dementia. It was true that it was closed by the state in the early 80\&#39;s. A lot of that may have to do with the age of the building or the right guy wasn\&#39;t paid off. This is after all Kentucky. The part of the documentary that turned me off the most was the piling of bodies into a cart. If I am not mistaken it appears to have been Holocaust footage. That was added for dramatic effect. It left me with a sour taste in my mouth for the filmmaker. I am a skeptic when it comes to &#34;Ghosts&#34;. I do believe that many around here truly think the place to be haunted. Waverly for me however symbolized a fun place for adventure for a boy with a sled.&#39;

b&#34;In another of the dreadful horror films I seem so masochistically attracted to, we have a bunch of friends stuck in a haunted house slowly being killed one by one thanks to a horde of zombies that spurt yellow blood and have very bad dental problems. The first 45 minutes is all talk however, and considering the young thespians cannot act their way out of a paper bag and are given the most banal dialogue ever to dispassionately recite, this is especially painful to sit through. If you manage to stay awake through that nonsense, things don&#39;t get any better.. with bad make-up galore and cheesy, bargain basement (not-so-special) effects. As for the conclusion.. well, what&#39;s the betting that the old-timer who warned them against going to the spooky mansion in the first place will turn up and save the day for the last two survivors (a boy and a girl, of course) with his mystical powers? Please.. life is too short for these kind of movies. Donate the time you would otherwise have spent watching this tripe helping out the community, do a couple of shifts in a soup kitchen or something. You&#39;ll feel you&#39;ve actually done something productive with your life, and you won&#39;t have put money into the pockets of studios who churn out irredeemable rubbish such as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it&#39;s already too late for me.. now, where did I put that copy of &#39;Pumpkinhead&#39;? 1/10&#34;

b&#34;While it would be easy and accurate to go into why &#39;Reba&#39; is at its heart indicative of many &#39;family-oriented sitcoms&#39; in the way it rips off from other better sitcoms, the real truth is that the show is repetitive, full of stereotypes from funnier and more groundbreaking shows, and the lead star is completely out of her element. While I&#39;m sure Ms. McIntire can sing and has a fan base that supports that, being in a sitcom shooting out zingers and calling her the next Lucille Ball is far, far removed from reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reba herself has no presence which is needed here to establish the fact that she is cast as the put-upon woman of which her entire family is centered. Yet after watching a few episodes there is no real connection to the character. I could care less about her adventures because her whole character seems to be MIA. Reba McIntire has no screen presence, and to make a show around her seems very short-sighted and indicative of most &#39;family-oriented&#39; programming: to push a sitcom full of men-stupid/women-do-everything stereotypes that appeal to nobody but those who can&#39;t afford cable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show is a waste of time. The only good thing is that it at least has better production values than your standard PAX ripoff....just.&#34;

b&#39;All I can say about this movie, is it is absolutely boring. The intro to the movie is quite possibly the worst intro to a horror film I have ever seen, I mean a angry chick hitting a guy in the head with a frying pan isn\&#39;t at all frightening which is what I assume the director was aiming for, but in fact it was &#34;mildly&#34; funny. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting in this picture was beyond pathetic; a note to directors, if your making a horror film, please hire some good actors, not some popular teen soap star who has no idea how to act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The death scenes in this movie were beyond boring... no gore, and i\&#39;m sorry but horror movies without gore, or good suspense are just cheesy. I mean this girl gets killed by hair wrapped all around her in the middle of Tokyo, and not one person sees it happen, they just declare her as &#34;missing&#34;, wow thats awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion if you and your friends want to see this movie, make sure u bring some sleeping pills, because I guarantee you won\&#39;t make it to the end.. Me and my friend walked out cause we didn\&#39;t even care what happened at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers&#39;

b&#34;I have seen this movie and in all honestly was quite disappointed. And in my opinion this movie lacks heart. I frankly didn&#39;t care what happen to the characters by the end of the movie. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was so much there they could have done with the movie that they didn&#39;t because they were either so rapped up in trying to be obscure and make some deep comment on life, or trying so hard not to, that the characters and story were completely lost in all of it. I have seen another picture by this director and enjoyed it well enough. But I felt this film lack of the whimsy and heart of the other and I was left wondering what the point was, or if the point of the movie was that it had no point. Honestly, while I didn&#39;t feel like tearing my hair out during the movie, I did remorse the lost time on the sad little film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that some people will love this movie, but frankly I didn&#39;t.&#34;

b&#39;Would somebody please explain why anybody would want to make a &#34;British neo-noir&#34; crime film with a cast almost entirely American? The accents spoken in this film are bloody awful! But entirely in keeping with the performances, which are so wooden, one fears to strike a match for setting the cast on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, what kind of disgusting, moronic, cynical crud is this? Even neo-noir films have some character you either feel for or want to feel for, even if they\&#39;re wretched and doomed; they at least have some decency to them, some sense that what they\&#39;ve done is wrong, or that a seemingly good plan has gone wrong, and that somehow they\&#39;re stuck with the responsibility for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not in this stanky stew. These characters are putrid, betraying each other, themselves, and the audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, note that they are low-lives - all right, nothing wrong with that - except that they seem to be living a life of luxury. For a film supposedly about desperate petty thieves, the keynote here is - ennui. It\&#39;s all so terribly dull and dross, doncha know. So let\&#39;s just rip some people off or maybe murder them, and go get laid in a luxury hotel. What ambition! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gooping this whole mess to some bottom of swampy muck are: boringly uneven pacing; predictable \&#39;action\&#39; sequences that aren\&#39;t; banal and incoherent set-design; made-for-bad-TV camera-work and editing; forgettable score; and an entire lack of any imagination or innovation in production and direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wholly unbelievable, unlikeable, and for less dedicated movie watchers(or masochists) like myself, utterly unwatchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other nasty things I would like to say about this nasty film, but they wouldn\&#39;t print them here. Suffice it to say, you can probably find something more useful to do with your time than watch this film - just about anything, in fact.&#39;

b&#34;If you like soap-series, you might like this film. I recommend this film to fans of Dutch soap-series like GTST, Westenwind or even American stuff like The Bold &amp; The Beautiful. If you don&#39;t like that stuff: stay away from this movie. It has the same kind of visual style, the same quality of acting, direction and writing.The film was a big hit at home territory, but wasn&#39;t sold anywhere else outside Holland and Belgium. Pretty strange for a commercial film like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it says something....&#34;

b&#39;&#34;Based on a joke once told by Jim Wynorski&#34;... that\&#39;s what I\&#39;ve read at the end of the closing credits. Well, Mr. Wynorski gotta have an awful sense of humour then! This film is terrible, really. I loved the first two chapters of The Slumber Party Massacre series; the third film was quite useless, but completely watchable, compared to this piece of crap! There\&#39;s not even a Driller Killer and the plot, the acting, the characters, the locations, the events... everything is boring, absurd and laughable. The only good reason to watch this turkey are the girls: if this film were a porn, I think it would have worked really much better! The film lacks gore too: the first scene (the one in the tent) could be bloodier and the scene with the headless guy knocking at the door lasted one second! Some moments of slight thrilling can\&#39;t save a nonexistent plot. Buzzy (Lunk Johnson) seems to be the only real actor here: I found him the only bearable character in this movie! Oh... there\&#39;s a nonsense part with Brinke Stevens, who performed &#34;Linda&#34; in the first Slumber Party Massacre: the police bother her to know more details about the killer; but what we get is only some footage from the first film! Not a dialogue, neither a monologue, or anything from this still-traumatized grown-up girl, who\&#39;s forced to revive the worst 30 minutes of her life (as she says), giving us no clues at all about the murderer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch at your own risk.&#39;

b&#39;Larry is a perfect example of the Democratic Party in the United States, of which he is a staunch member. King used to be somewhat fair and unbiased and had a variety of guests on. The Party used to be centrist, too, but that was another era. Now, like, Larry, it\&#39;s Far Left. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least 90 percent of all the guests on King\&#39;s show in the past year or two are Liberals who sit there and bash President Bush and every Conservative they can think of.....night after night. Bill Mahar, one of the more viscous ones, is - and you can look this up - the most frequent guest in the history of King\&#39;s TV show. You can count on other outspoken Left Wingers to be on King\&#39;s show each week, but don\&#39;t hold your breath waiting for a Conservative. They are few and far between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King was also one of the innovators of the media overkill. That all began with the O.J. Simpson trial. Night after night after night that\&#39;s all you ever saw back in the mid \&#39;90s. Whatever latest gossip on Anna Nicole Smith, or the Petersen murder case, or Paris Hilton, Britney Spears or some other tabloid subject, you can bet Larry will beat it to death. Sadly, all the other networks do the same thing now. Larry was a leader in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King also has the nerve to sometimes give advice, such as on marriage. I am not kidding; I \&#39;ve heard him say it. The joke is that he has been married and divorced a half dozen times! This man has few scruples, believe me. When it comes to morality, he is clueless. Maybe that\&#39;s why he has Dr. Phil on, to explain some facts of life to him regularly. Larry will nod, but he doesn\&#39;t understand any more than when Billy Graham used to talk to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King also is becoming famous for the &#34;softball&#34; interview, meaning he asks no hard questions. That is a lot due to the fact that most his guests are of his political persuasion. People know being on King\&#39;s show is liking having an hour public relations gig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What all this has meant is a serious decline in ratings the past five years. People see through him and his Liberal-and-tabloid-TV mentality and switched over from King and CNN to Fox News.&#39;

b&#39;You know, I was very surprised when watching this movie. It aired during the day once when i was sick, and having nothing else to do, I continued watching. This is by far the WORST MOVIE EVER! But to my surprise I kept watching. I sat there saying, this is terrible, but yet didn\&#39;t change the channel because I was so amused at how bad it was. Maybe It was the guy that looked like Big tom from survivor or the dreadful moustaches and mohawks these characters had, that kept me watching. However, the girls weren\&#39;t half bad, but if that\&#39;s what you want, there is far better. Oh, and there\&#39;s &#34;NINJAS&#34; and &#34;PAJAMA BOYS!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you like ninja\&#39;s, bad acting, hilarious(and terrible) dialogue, and two twins who are five feet tall and killing everything in their sight, then this movie is for you. It\&#39;s so bad it\&#39;s good. However, I just had to give it a 1 out of ten. I couldn\&#39;t have put a 10 on it up there with Lord of the Rings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ENJOY!!!!!!!!! :)&#39;

b&#39;I see absolutely nothing funny---even remotely funny---in this stupid movie. An unrealistic, silly, ridiculous idea--just completely ridiculous. Hard to believe that the main character, who seems so articulate, intelligent and imaginative, would not be accepted to any college. Even more difficult to believe is that no one shut the place down. The actors portrayed characters straight out of Characterville. We have seen their lot many a time over in many films. Nothing new here. I found it on late night TV, and since there was really nothing else on, I watched the whole boring, stupid film. What a total waste. Maybe if you are a teenager, you may find it amusing. Films are made for an immature mind, so teens, go for it. The rest, no way.&#39;

b&#34;If this film was just outrageously poor would be fine, the problem is many take it seriously. To make it short, a few points: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There is no story, no focus, no lead whatsoever and all the questions raised fail to find an answer. Overall, the film is extremely repetitive and boring (I have been in war-torn African countries several times and found all the lingering on local misery and hopelessness very painful to watch but still having no sense).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Questions raised are pure manipulation and the truth is that they are no questions but statements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I am no doc filmmaker, but what&#39;s the point in raising, for example, the question of weapon smuggling, if the only element brought to the audience is a local reporter&#39;s statement? The director doesn&#39;t even bother showing us at least a sequence where he would be waiting near the airport trying to spot heavily loaded trucks leaving the area right after a plane landed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The story of the fish takes up less than 5 mn, and is only supported by a sequence where the director films a documentary shown during a local conference. Did this guy do any work at all???? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Abject poverty is shown all the time in endless sequences but where&#39;s the point? One can go almost anywhere in Africa with a hand cam and shoot the same images unfortunately. Where&#39;s the big news? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Filming the prostitutes watching and crying over images of their assassinated friend and fellow prostitute is worth the worst emotional manipulations one can see these days on thrash and real TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The parallel drawn between the famine devastating the country with over two million starving and the exportation of fish is absolutely pointless, dishonest and makes no sense but to manipulate viewers in typically anti-globalization and anti-western feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an interesting debate in France after an academic published a very detailed comment on the film, which brought number of journalists working in Africa for decades to investigate a bit further about several details. It turns out that: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The fish waste shown drying in the sun and collected by some local people is not at all meant to be eaten by human beings but is collected to be exported for reasonably good money for animal-feeding purposes. I think I am not the only one having had the impression that the director suggested the exact opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Arm smuggling is a reality (but there again, where&#39;s the big news??), but not the way this film explains the issue. If the empty planes landing in Mwanza do participate in smuggling, they actually unload their shipment in a different location in Africa, then go to Mwanza to pick up fish in order not to make the trip back empty (meaning that they do actually land empty in Mwanza...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- People do eat fish locally, contrary to what the film suggest (around 40-60% of what is taken out of the lake) and thousands of people make their living with it. Good for them! It&#39;s private business of that kind that will one day take African countries out of poverty and not western moaning and endless foreign assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell how shocked I am seeing the success of this film!&#34;

b&#39;Has this ever happened to you? I go into my local video store and see a few new arrivals in the &#34;film noir&#34; section. I spy a copy of a new arrival of a film I have never seen called NAKED ALIBI. Its from one of those mail order video companies that offers (mostly) &#34;dupey&#34; looking copies of hard to find titles. The description on the box sounds good. The film has players I like (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grahame, and Gene Barry). So I take it home and watch it. About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts. About half way through this film I started to dislike it. By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it. The film opens with cops questioning Al Willis on suspicion of robbery. Other than being drunk, the police have nothing on him. When he pushes a cop and demands to be allowed to go home, the cops beat him up. Detective Conroy arrives, lets the cops finish the beating and then announces Willis is in the clear. Willis swears he will get revenge. Later one of the police officers is shot dead. With no evidence other that Willis is &#34;sore&#34; about the beating, Conroy make Willis his sole suspect, despite the fact that his boss names a pair of mobsters as suspects. Conroy arrests him, but for lack evidence Willis is released. The next day two more cops are killed by a bomb. This time Conroy goes to the Bakery that Willis owns and tries to beat a confession out of him. Conroy doesn\&#39;t know it but a local newsman whose paper has been accusing Conroys department of police brutality snaps a picture of Conroy trying strangle Willis and Conroy is fired. But Conroy continues his pursuit and Willis flees to Mexico where Willis has a mistress. Conroy manages to convince his mistress (who Willis treats rather rough) to help him prove Willis is a killer. What this film lacks is a convincing script. The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed. Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it. Other than the fact that Willis likes to tip a glass now and than, there is nothing in the early part of the film to make us think that he is a crazy killer that cheats on his wife. He treats his wife, his kid and employees well. Early in the film, one gets the impression that its Conroy is the one whose is a loose cannon. He seems to casually approve of police brutality. Conroy, for no reason is convinced from the very start Willis has criminal past. He seems to operate on the motto of the old Communist Bulgarian secret police; &#34;Everyone is guilty of something, we just have not found out about it yet.&#34; Later Conroy shows kindness to Al\&#39;s mistress and young son, now we are supposed to like him. Sorry! The early impression I got of Conroy stuck with me too long. And he is also a dumb cop. Only after he is fired and goes to Mexico does he run a background check on Willis and discovers that a warrant is out for him issued in Maryland. Why didn\&#39;t he think of this before? Because this film hadn\&#39;t used up enough running time. The cast is good. Gene Barry does well considering how poorly conceived his role of Al Willis is. I\&#39;m big fan of 40\&#39;s and 50\&#39;s crime thrillers but not only did I not think this film was good, it left a bad taste in my mouth (something many modern films do, but older films rarely do).&#39;

b&#34;If you are thinking of going to see this film then my advice is - dont.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the film failed to make the grade at every level and was a reminder of how dire most British (&amp; Irish)films are. Forgettable tripe is the best i can say. If it had been on telly l would have wandered off to do something more interesting five minutes after the start. I saw this film with a group of friends and having read the press previews went along prepared to not be critical and hopefully pass an amusing 90 minutes. But, oh dear.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a comedy it wasn&#39;t funny, as a thriller the stupid story was sloppy and lazy. As a love story totally unbelievable. Most of all as a piece of &#39;gloriously over the top whimsy&#39; it lacked both style and charm. Gambon and Caine did what they needed to do to earn their money playing er..... Gambon and Caine. Is it just me, but other than playing east end gangsters and jack the lads, does Michael Caine leave you cold?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, some of my friends thought it was &#39;ok&#39; but if you do go, my advice is have a few drinks (or puffs) beforehand and leave your critical faculties safely locked up at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;

b&#39;I found this an awfully disappointing experience! But I have appended a better option of similar style at the foot of this entry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &#34;Felicia\&#39;s Journey&#34; is intriguing. It has drama. But it is full of stereo-types! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it ONLY serves judgemental temperaments without concern for truer justice &amp; fairness &amp; truth, beyond black \&#39;n\&#39; white judgements that fit 30-second ads of &#34;NEWS&#34; that dot our multimedia experiences everyday, especially news bulletins, true or misleading in such depictions! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is SO EXAGGERATED, it reminds me of the fairytale of &#34;Little Red Ridinghood&#34;! Consider the innocent young girl with no identification crossing borders questioned by a guard but freed without any evidence to venture on in search of her \&#39;Romeo\&#39; who didn\&#39;t give her an address VERSUS the pathetically inept lack of substance in the raspy voice of the \&#39;helping hand\&#39; befriending her with his unlikely story fabricated by the layer! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to suit the directors &amp; management team that no-one has faith or prays to God, even in their times of desperation! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in these early settings, it orchestrates &amp; tells much of what is to come! A nightmare journey that betrays the essence of substance without fairytale resolution, without truth or integrity or credibility! ...Then one twist &amp; it\&#39;s all over. What a disappointment! If you want to see a MUCH superior movie that investigates similar themes with MUCH more credibility, with much more powerful insight, watch the 1983 Paul Cox/Norman Kaye &#34;Man of Flowers&#34; movie!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike here, you will NOT be disappointed!&#39;

b&#34;Subspecies is set in Romania where two American college students Michele (Laura Mae Tate) &amp; Lillian (Michelle McBride) arrive to study local folklore with the aid of local friend Mara (Irina Movila). There they rent rooms in a hotel &amp; become curious about the mysterious ruins of a nearby castle, it turns out that a powerful &amp; evil Vampire named Radu (Anders Hove) lives there who has stolen the Bloodstone from his father King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm). Radu takes a fancy to the three girls &amp; starts drinking the blood of Mara &amp; Lillian, meanwhile Michele falls for a guy named Stefan (Michael Watson) who just so happens to be Radu&#39;s brother. Michele &amp; Stefan decide to team up &amp; rid the world of the evil Radu...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directed by Ted Nicolaou this film seems to be quite highly regarded amongst genre fans &amp; while it&#39;s not terrible I certainly wouldn&#39;t call it very good &amp; I could&#39;t really see anything much to get excited about. Subspecies is a rather slow going film, not that much actually happens &amp; while it does try to stay close to certain classic Vampire lore there&#39;s all this nonsense about a Bloodstone &amp; some little monsters that grow from the tips of Radu&#39;s severed fingers for some reason. Subspecies could have been a half decent film if not for the fact that it&#39;s dull, I really can&#39;t remember that much about it, good or bad. The character&#39;s are alright but some f the dialogue is silly &amp; there&#39;s a scene which bugged me near the start when the girls are at the castle ruins &amp; one says they have to go because it&#39;s getting dark yet it&#39;s still clearly the middle of the day &amp; very bright. There&#39;s also a scene where one of the American girls finds a coffin that hotel&#39;s attic &amp; doesn&#39;t really seem that bothered by it, I am not being funny but is some bloke whose house I was staying at had a coffin in his attic I would be very, very worried if you know what I mean. I don&#39;t think I would ever want to watch it again, there&#39;s no real threat, the plot is weak that mixes classic Vampire themes with silly subplots &amp; I was distinctly unmoved by it all. Not the worst film ever but hardly the best either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film looks alright with nice locations &amp; some local scenery although you feel the look is down to the budget rather than the makers attempt a authenticity. There&#39;s not much gore apart from a decapitation &amp; some broken off finger tips. For no apparent reason the makers throw in some average looking stop-motion animated monsters that really don&#39;t do anything or have much significance to the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filmed on the cheap by Charles Band&#39;s Full Moon Entertainment production company in Bucharest in Romania, the production values are alright &amp; better than many later day Band productions. The acting isn&#39;t great with many of the cast putting in below par performances while genre regular Angus Scrimm has a small cameo at the start. There&#39;s a little bit of style here on occasion with a few scene reminding heavily of the original Nosferatu (1922) in particular the bit showing Radu&#39;s shadow coming down the stair with his long claw like fingernails standing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subspecies is a film that many seem to like for reasons I don&#39;t quite see, I thought it was throughly average at best &amp; overall rather dull. Followed by Bloodstone: Subspecies II (1993), Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994), Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm (1998) &amp; the spin0off film Vampire Journals (1997).&#34;

b&#39;What could\&#39;ve been a great film about the late poker pro (pre-poker craze) Stu &#34;The Kid&#34; Unger turned into a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can tell the filmmakers were working on a short-string budget. Everything look filmed on the cheap. Timelines seemed a bit off to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Casting Michael Imperoli from the Sopranos was also a bad casting choice. He looked too old to play the baby-faced Stu, he looked way too healthy for a coke addict (if you look at footage from the 1997 WSOP main event, the real Stu was so skinny and he practically had no nose from too much cocaine so he wore those sunglasses to hide them), and I kept expecting Adriana to pop up and yell &#34;Chris-tu-phur!!!&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also they skipped over the fact that he had a son from Angie\&#39;s previous relationship that committed suicide in the late \&#39;80s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I saw Vincent Van Patten appear, I kept thinking he was going to announce &#34;Show tunes going off in Stu\&#39;s head.&#34; like he does on the WPT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you\&#39;re looking for real Stuey footage, check ESPN Classic because they rerun the 1997 WSOP Main Event every so often. Or try YouTube. Avoid this move like a bad beat.&#39;

b&#39;I do not generally appreciate light-weight attempts at creating humourous stories, which means that &#34;Anita no perd el Tren&#34; cannot score very high for me. The story is good: a middle-aged but still good-looking woman finds a new love. But the attempts at making this film as a romantic comedy only managed at times to be somewhat comical. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosa Mar\xc3\xada Sard\xc3\xa0 has ably demonstrated that she can be a serious actress in such productions as &#34;Amic/Amat&#34; (qv), &#34;Todo Sobre mi Madre&#34; (qv), &#34;Las Amargas L\xc3\xa1grimas de Petra von Kant&#34; (qv) and &#34;El Embrujo de Shanghai&#34; (qv). However the powers that be have over the years dished her out a lot of trivial stuff, for the cinema and for TV. Something similar could be said of Jos\xc3\xa9 Coronado: perfectly able to produce serious performances. Mar\xc3\xada Barranco belongs safely in this grouping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such that, in the end, I was left with the feeling that I would be real pleased to see a new making of this film, in a serious tone, which would allow the actors to really show their performing skills. And the curious thing is that it should be done with exactly the same leading actors. Wasted talent on a rather silly film that could have been very promising indeed.&#39;

b&#34;I saw Hurlyburly on Broadway and liked it a great deal. I don&#39;t know what happened with the film version, because it was dreadful. Perhaps some dialogue that works on stage just sounds incoherent on screen. Anyway, I couldn&#39;t wait for this film to be over. The acting is universally over the top. Only Kevin Spacey has it together, and he seems like he knows he&#39;s in a bad movie and can&#39;t wait to get out.&#34;

b&#39;I think &#34;category 6: day of destruction&#34; was very unrealistic. The digital effects where like a children\&#39;s cartoon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actors didn\&#39;t act realistically, for example, when the girl was shot she acted like she got tomato sauce splatted on her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie was boring but I watched it because it was on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only interesting character was Tornado Tommy, he was funny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep the special effects real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the comment: &#34;What did we do to p.i.s.s-off Mother Nature?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t know what else to write to fill up the 10 lines. What else can I say the movie is so boring, I think my comment will be equally boring.&#39;

b&#39;With a title like that, you will be forgiven for thinking this film is about the great painter, Goya. Then after half an hour you decide it is more about the Roman Catholic Inquisition. With even more latitude, perhaps it is just a snapshot of the period. With lurid characterisation, too many axes to grind and a scant regard for fact, Milos Forman dishes up a colourful but shambolic, rambling mish-mash that fails on all three accounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Milos Forman (who lost his Jewish father to Nazi concentration camps), is the great director who painted the artist Mozart as a buffoon and got away with it. Won awards for it, in fact. His life in Czechoslovakia gave him a taste of diverse, repellent regimes, especially Communism. He also made the equally over-the-top but rather impressive, One Flew Over the Cuckoo\&#39;s Nest. So, at the age of 74, how does he come to offer us this mess? In Goya\&#39;s Ghosts, Goya is one step removed from buffoon. The main character is Brother Lorenzo, passionately acted by Javier Bardem. Natalie Portman is equally vibrant as Goya\&#39;s model Ines (and later in the film, her own daughter). The tenuous connection with Goya is that he happens to paint both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lorenzo tortures (and then rapes) Ines who he suspects of being a Jew. Her father tortures Lorenzo. Napoleon dashes in to liberate Spain (briefly). Ines gets out of the dungeon the Church has left her in and searches for her child. Goya is still painting but has gone deaf. His main preoccupation seems to be helping Ines. And so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Historically, Goya was also a historian. As Forman had sadly relinquished the idea of a biopic of Goya the painter, this one fact could have been used to pull the whole film together \xc2\x96 a large slice of history as seen by Goya. But the painter is too tangential to receive any weight. Similarly, a document of the terrors of the Inquisition should be done \xc2\x96 compared to other despotic orders throughout time, the Holy See has been forgiven with barely a confession. Though one might ask if Forman is competent enough to be trusted with a factual account of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;I thought this could be the heart of a wonderful story,&#34; he says in the production notes. &#34;There were a great many parallels between the Communist society we lived under and the Spanish Inquisition.&#34; But the story is too tenuous to hold our attention. Against our expectations and with a background of something major (the life of a great painter, the horrors of the Inquisition, and even the French Revolution), we are instead asked to feel involved in a concocted (if kind) infatuation of Goya\&#39;s. The result is that we feel cheated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background detail is appallingly handled. Goya went deaf in 1792 (when the film starts), not 15 years later. Napoleon is as believable as a cut-out from a cereal packet. We see the Church passing out a death sentence (when the normal procedure was for the Church to insist that the secular arm did that dirty work). Battles look overly-choreographed and stagey. A peppering of gratuitous naked bosoms hardly makes up for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, the production values are mostly good. The colours are vivid, the pacing excellent (at least until we give up on finding any worthwhile storyline.) Bardem is excellent, and Portman is a joy until she goes into overdrive as a mad woman. While it doesn\&#39;t say very much about Goya, what it does say is nice, even if superficial and pretty irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once had a late night drunken conversation where my friends and I asked each other, if you could choose a director to depict your life, who would it be? On his record, Forman would sadly have to be at the bottom of my list.&#39;

b&#39;Johnnie (Bert Wheeler) is a would-be songwriter; Newton (Robert Woolsey) is a would-be inventor. Both work at a cigar stand in the lobby of an office building. Johnnie wants to sell a song to Winfield Lake, a song publisher who also owns the building. Lake\&#39;s secretary, Mary (Betty Grable), is Johnnie\&#39;s sweetheart. When Lake turns up dead, circumstances conspire to make Mary and Newton think that Johnnie is the killer. They conspire again to implicate Mary, who goes to jail. But who really shot Lake? Who is the Black Widow, the blackmailer who had threatened him? The other characters in this wacky murder mystery are: Lake\&#39;s suspicious wife, a self-satisfied private detective, a seemingly slow-witted janitor (Willie Best), Lake\&#39;s auditor, a songwriter who thinks Lake is stealing from him and another who thinks everyone is stealing from him. It\&#39;s up to Newton and his truth machine to reveal the real killer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The baby-voiced Wheeler and the cigar-chomping Woolsey strike me as an arbitrary pairing, but they made several movies together in the 30s and some of them were funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this one. George Stevens, who went on to have a distinguished career, directed this dismal comedy with a tedious murder mystery plot. But two scenes are good, and both feature Wheeler and Betty Grable singing the excellent &#34;Music in My Heart,&#34; written by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh. The first time, they sing it walking up a staircase (after which they dance back down). Later, Wheeler and Woolsey are on stilts so that they can see and talk to Mary, who is in a jail cell on a high floor. Wheeler and Grable sing to each other through the bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Nitwits&#34; has a few laughs, but the level of comedy is best illustrated by Woolsey\&#39;s line: &#34;Sonny, you\&#39;ve got the brain of a six-year-old boy. And I\&#39;ll bet even he was glad to get rid of it.&#34; It\&#39;s watered-down Groucho\xc2\x97who didn\&#39;t use the superfluous &#34;even&#34; when he said it.&#39;

b&#34;I am a huge Randolph Scott fan, so I was surprised and disappointed to find he is barely in this film! The movie really belongs to Robert Ryan, who is the hero in the jam, and the one embroiled in the love triangle. Good grief, Gabby Hayes gets more screen time than Mr. Scott in this movie!! For many viewers, that is not a problem, but I am from the Walter Brennan school of sidekicks, not Gabby Hayes...although I will say that his lines were a bit more humorous than annoying in this film than in many of his films with Randolph Scott and John Wayne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I found the movie very slow going, with a convoluted plot that was muddied even more by the unnecessary romance subplot. By convoluted, I don&#39;t mean impossible to understand or figure out, I just mean too messy for its own good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The direction is uninspired, and the two main bad guys have the most unsatisfying come-uppance at the end. The whole movie comes across as fake, unrealistic, and poorly filmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just so you don&#39;t think I can&#39;t find anything good here...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, Anne Jeffreys is very sexy in her all-too-brief parts of this film. Not sure if it is actually her singing, or someone else, but whoever it was had a very pretty voice. Ms. Jeffreys also had a couple of nice acting moments. The script needed either a lot more of her, or to remove her character altogether. As it was, her nice few moments weren&#39;t enough to help the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, there is Mr. Scott. He looks fantastic in this film and is the no-nonsense lawman out to set things right. Some folks complain that his characters prior to 1950 were too goody-goody perfect, but that&#39;s never bothered me at all. I&#39;ll take him goody-goody pre-1950, or gritty and violent post-1950...either way, Randolph Scott was a real Western hero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It saddens me to have to say it, but I would have to recommend passing this film by, unless you are a die-hard fan...there are so many better Scott films out there that this one won&#39;t be missed.&#34;

b&#39;I fail to see how anyone who has actually read the M. Didius Falco mysteries could make such a mockery of them. An Aussie has no business in Ancient Rome. Nothing of the books is in this film except the setting and characters, and they are wasted on a plot thin enough through which to read the silly script. Kevin Connor and Lee Zlotoff have a lot of nerve displaying their names in the credits.&#39;

b&#39;Although I can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it\&#39;s intrigue, I most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers. Enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained &#34;your father died today&#34; comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This won first place at Cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering. Perhaps the French had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film. I understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once it\&#39;s over. I LOVED movies such as &#34;Trainspotting&#34; or &#34;Requiem for a Dream&#34; - which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing. To watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that I found it tedious - and I really wanted to like this film at every turn.&#39;

b&#34;I watched the 1st scarecrow movie and didn&#39;t bag out that one, though i knew it was b grade it actually had some decent gore and the guy playing the scarecrow was an awesome acrobat and had some good skills going. The effects were better and the costume looked heaps better then this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I borrowed this one with an open mind, i am also a fan of ken shamrock (former ufc superfight champ) and was hoping it was a decent movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy was i wrong, the movie sucked, the monster was pathetic in both appearance and in actually being scary, the storyline was SO predictable it was like watching the movie in preview mode, as i already would guess what will happen, the music was so bad, with a horrible lip sync song that made me wanna punch the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall avoid this crappy movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save some money.&#34;

b&#34;I was only fourteen when I first saw the Alien movies and I immediately came to like it. Original, terrifying and classic. Sigourney Weaver was the perfect choice for the female hero character and she would have deserved a statuette for her act. In 1979 something everlasting was born than the immortal series continued with a nothing less legendary movie than the first. Alien3 was a different point of view but I think this part was the most stressful and unique of all, this was my favourite. Unfortunately the last one was a failure in many ways. It was strained, illogical with full of meaningless massacres. I didn&#39;t like it at all, but I never thought that a worse part would ever be made in the future. Well as it turned out in 2004 I was wrong. Alien vs. Predator was a bad break, and it should have been directed by a more talented director or should have never been made at all. But when I saw Alien vs Predator Requiem I was totally shocked moreover devastated. When I sat down and decided to watch it with full of doubt, even than I had never thought that such a bad movie could be made. Without a screenplay, without a director and without actors I don&#39;t understand how can a film be made. Because this film misses these three terms. What you get is a nice massacre show without a story but with a lot of annoying and boring dialogues. Waste of money and waste of time. This movie is rather impudence, than honor to the fans of the both sides (Alien/Predator). Shame!&#34;

b&#34;This is one of the most ridiculous westerns that Hollywood ever made. Gary Cooper plays &#39;Reb Hollister&#39;, a former confederate officer wanted by the law. He meets up with a moron named Weatherby, played by Leif Erickson, who is a U.S. Marshal with no knowledge of firearms. Weatherby is on his way to Dallas to see his fiancee, Tonia Robles, played by Ruth Roman. Senor Robles, Tonia&#39;s father, has plenty of men, but they can&#39;t seem to be able to keep an eye on his cattle, which are regularly rustled by the Marlow brothers. Will Marlow, played by Raymond Massey, has financed the loan on the Robles estate, making things completely absurd. He even has the power to call for mortgage payments before they&#39;re due, simply because he feels like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Weatherby is a Boston boy who can&#39;t fight, since he only became a Marshal so he could visit his fiancee, Tonia, (Just another instance of more plot nonsense. Are we to assume that you only have to pass a written test to get this job? Wait a minute, this guy couldn&#39;t pass the written test either.) he switches identities with Reb Hollister, who of course is an expert gunman. Reb takes the liberty of greeting Weatherby&#39;s girl with a passionate kiss, while Weatherby looks on like an idiot. Gary Cooper, Hollywood&#39;s number one stud, is in fine form here as Reb. Before the movie&#39;s done, not only does he take Weatherby&#39;s job, he steals his fiancee also, and Ruth Roman as Tonia, falls for him so hard and so fast that she gives chump Leif Erickson the brush-off before the films little more than half over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#39;t a shred of plot credibility in the whole film, so despite the good cast and lush photography, the film is a dud. And Cooper&#39;s character is a complete heel to boot. The film also stars Barbara Payton as Brant Marlow&#39;s girl, a beautiful and talented actress who squandered away her chances, unfortunately, by making too many headlines for the wrong reasons. I strongly suggest you pass this one up.&#34;

b&#34;A really very bad movie, with a very few good moments or qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts off with pregnant Linda Blair, who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks, I&#39;m not sure. She jumps through a window and wakes up, and we see she is very pregnant. The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who I thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island. Italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies! On the island already are David Hasselhoff and his German-speaking virgin girlfriend (you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff...). He&#39;s taking photographs, and she&#39;s translating an esoteric German book about witches, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it, and a real estate agent, and a woman I thought was their daughter. Evidently she was an architect, and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couple&#39;s children. I guess they all traveled to the island together, but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them (maybe they were filmed separately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hotel seems neat, certainly from the exteriors, but it isn&#39;t used to any great effect. An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in German sometimes, which he eventually records on his Sesame Street tape recorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People start getting killed, either in their dreams, or sucked into hell or something. Some of these gore scenes are OK, but not enough to recommend the movie. Though the copy I watched stated it is uncut on the box cover, the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut. Much of the scene is showing another character&#39;s reaction shots, since we&#39;re not seeing anything ourselves. The creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy-looking wound of a mouth rapes someone. He looked particularly nasty. There&#39;s a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed. I wish if a horror movie is going to cast her, they would do something original with her role, and let her leave Exorcist behind her (except for the yearly horror conventions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the weird, largely Italian, tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to, this is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2. That is, it is supposedly a sequel to Casa 3 - Ghosthouse, La (1988) - it&#39;s not (that&#39;s also a better movie than this one). La Casa 1 and two were The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 (and much better than those). There&#39;s also a Casa 5, La (1990) AKA House 5, which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series and the series House: House (1986) House II: The Second Story (1987), The Horror Show (1989) AKA House III, and House IV (1992). How&#39;s The Horror Show fit in there? It doesn&#39;t really, it claimed to be a sequel, thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less (or more?) confusion. Oddly, The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House, and La Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House 2. Does your head hurt yet?&#34;

b&#39;I saw and have the original 1959 black and white that stars Shelley Winters and Millie Perkins and no matter how many times I watch it, I can\&#39;t help but not to cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This version was (obviously) a set, like the 1959 was, but there were so many mistakes in layout. Spiral staircase? Items that did not exist in that time period existed in the film. Doris Roberts, sad to say CANNOT play drama, she a comedic actress and that will not change. James Coco was a horrible Mr. Van Daan and Mr. Dussel resembled a college professor of mine rather then the dentist he was supposed to play. In the original film, Anne walked the &#34;gauntlet&#34; to go to Peter\&#39;s room, that seemed to take her more then a minute. In this crappy remake, it took her under 10 seconds. The first reviewer was correct... This remake is just that, a remake. What was the director thinking casting comedic actors in a drama role like that. I\&#39;m sorry but James Coco cannot play drama. Max.. Schell was better in Deep Impact then this movie. The cranky Mrs. Frank was just that cranky, I couldn\&#39;t stand her. Referencing and comparing to the 1959 version, I like her better, she did a better job of being the overwhelming mother. Out of 10 stars, I give this remake 3. Don\&#39;t waste your time, get the 1959 version and a box of Kleenex.&#39;

b&#39;This should be re-named &#34;Everybody Loves Sebastian&#34;. The 1983 rural go-nowhere town high school junior (or senior? - they seemed to flip flop on that one) with weird hair and &#34;Leo-like&#34; good looks has a big plate full of issues. His step-dad announces definite plans to have a sex-change operation, upon which his mom calls the marriage quits; Sebastian is called the &#34;f&#34; word by everyone and their mother, all-the-while &#34;kissing around&#34; with various girls, getting high on Ready-Whip at a supermarket, and saving a &#34;strawberry&#34; prostitute from the clutches of her ruthless pimp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sebastian\&#39;s &#34;buddies&#34; make Eddie Haskal look like a choir boy; bad association doesn\&#39;t get much worse. Sebastian seems to go for &#34;Harold\&#39;s&#34; suicide attempts record (although he won\&#39;t admit suicidal tendanccies). For no apparent reason the genius level SAT scoring Sebastian MUST graduate a year early, although he has no clue about the future, nor does he want to attend college (what gives with this nonsense?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is a look into a few weeks in the life of someone who is PRETTY MESSED UP. The final scene suggests that things will be alright, although the HOW is left entirely up to the viewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makers of this film seem to bank solely on the undisputed appeal of the very attractive male lead. The &#34;story&#34; leaves a lot to be desired. Looking for &#34;what will this gorgeous kid do next...?&#34; doesn\&#39;t exactly satisfy. The lackluster production values just don\&#39;t measure up to other films, independent or otherwise. A low budget and weak story need more than a pretty face to carry it through. The &#34;results&#34; of this project are forgettable and an insult to intelligent cinema fans.&#39;

b&#39;My goodness. And here I thought that there were no directors worse than Uwe Boll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine the number of decisions necessary to produce a motion picture. Conceptual approval. Scriptwriting. Dialogue editing. Casting. Set and prop design. Location selection. Acting. Timing. Cinematography. Lighting. Music. Sound and video editing. Direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Result: Dracula 3000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a film supposedly set in the 2900s, this movie looks surprisingly like a cheap gangsta flick of the 1970\&#39;s. The set is ridiculous for the period. The dialogue is atrocious. The timing of each scene is ludicrous. The acting is beyond abysmal. Everything stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s just take props, for example. If you have a movie set on a space freighter built in 2900, how likely is it that it will have the exposed piping and hydraulic doors of a 1960\&#39;s era oil tanker? What, technology hasn\&#39;t changed in 900 years? The \&#39;Professor\&#39; uses a standard tandy keyboard and Radio-Shack flipswitches to &#34;reprogram&#34; the computer. What, they haven\&#39;t figured out voice control yet? Of course, the Prof is tethered to a wheelchair. With wheels. Even though, you know, they\&#39;ve got intergalactic hyperdrive...but apparently not even a motorized wheelchair, much less a floating one, or bionic legs or something. And apparently this freighter was carrying an intergalactic consignment of rosewood caskets. How convenient. Then there are the weapons -- the crew carry standard late 20th-century firearms. In a ship. In the vacuum of space, where one bullethole would kill them all. Nice planning there, prop department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, why go on.&#39;

b&#34;I as a Christian am outraged after seeing just the first half of this picture. The film&#39;s website says they researched the movie before writing but I believe they forgot to consult the ultimate source THE BIBLE. I sat with two different versions of the Bible and could not find half of what happened or was said in this picture. It was like they made up what was not in the Bible and changed what was in the Bible to what they thought modern film viewers would want to see instead of the truth. I personally am too young to remember the 1950&#39;s Ten Commandments but it can&#39;t be any worse than this. I have written to the network and can only hope they publicly apologize for this travesty.&#34;

b&#34;I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie. What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles? The fact is that there are no volcanoes in Los Angeles. This movie should not be filmed in Los Angeles, it should be filmed in Honolulu Hawaii. Hawaii has volcanoes which is a real fact that this movie should be made in Hawaii&#39;s state capital. This movie should be filmed in Hawaii because this is the real idea and not in Los Angeles. There are earthquakes in Los Angeles, but there are no volcanoes. To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish. In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.&#34;

b&#34;This film has some nice special effects, tearing apart the Japanese archipelago to a degree that would humble Godzilla. The two leads also put in above-par performances. Apart from that, it is all a bit ropey in this understated disaster flick. The incongruities in the pacing are bizarre. At one point we have Hokkaido sinking into the sea and pyroclastic snow falling on the rest of Japan, while Osaka is buried under an immense tsunami. Yet elsewhere in the country, people are still strolling around sightseeing and licking ice-cream when another tsunami rolls in... Kusanagi also manages to travel great distances without any hindrance, or even a crease in his cream shirt. Other people turn up with burns, ripped clothes and mud-streaks on their faces. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Japaneseness of the film is both touching and repugnant. Kusanagi&#39;s sacrifice in his final evening with Shibasaki is a touch of chivalry seldom seen in this genre these days. However, the ill-fated PMs musings on the Japanese psyche and the seduction of death, and the fact that Japan is abandoned by everyone and has no friends in the last instance, hint at a darker paranoia that infects Japanese concerns regarding their status in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, the final sequence is a rip-off of Armaggedon, edited with a cookie-cutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my own particular bug-bear - the heavy handed product placement for cigarettes. This time around, it is mad(-or-is-he?) scientist Toyokawa who gets to be the poster boy for Japan Tobacco. At one point, he manages to light up 5000 meters below the ocean surface, in a miniature sub the size of a phone box. Gimme a break.&#34;

b&#39;While studying the differences between religion and cult in college, Mindy (Rachel Miner), who is the best student in the class, convinces her schoolmates Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk), Alex (Joel Michaely) and Morgan (Victoria Venegas) to research the massacre of worshipers of Kwan Yin by their leader Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson) twenty years ago in California. Quinlin had found an ancient amulet in Southern China that would give an enormous power to him after the sacrifice of human souls, but one woman resists and he is destroyed. However, after the death of Morgan, who apparently committed suicide, the students discover that Quinlin has returned and is chasing their souls with his amulet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The storyline of \&#39;Cult&#34; is not totally bad. Unfortunately, the screenplay, the direction, the acting, the lines, the camera, the CGI and the edition are awful. I was completely bored and tempted to use the FF button of the DVD, but I resisted and wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this never-ending crap on a Saturday night. My vote is two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;O Amuleto Secreto&#34; (&#34;The Secret Charm&#34;)&#39;

b&#39;This movie was lacking in a lot of areas. It\&#39;s about this Elvis type guy who races cars and is approached by these BIKERS from SATANS ANGELS. One of them is named Banjo and they beat up college kids for fun. THey want the Elvis guy to be their &#34;driver&#34;. At times, I wanted the folks from MSTK3000 to be quiet because the movie was actually kind of good. Sure, there was violence and a lot of cheesy lines, such as &#34;What kind of beer do you want? A COLD ONE&#34;. That was cheesy. The dude who plays Banjo is a great boxer and I was glad to see him do a few fight scenes. Also, the biker named FATS had a NAZI SWASTIKA on his jacket!!! That was pretty bold if I must say so myself.&#39;

b&#39;&#34;Milo&#34; is yet another answer to a question nobody ever asked.Do we really need more slashers?I for one think we already have more than enough.I guess the professional tall guys overcharged so in this one we deal with a murderous kid that\&#39;s also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it.A long time ago,he drowned but that didn\&#39;t bother him and he still kills people(&#34;Friday the 13th&#34;,what\&#39;s that?).One day,his survivors have a big reunion and as a surprise twist,Milo comes to pay them a visit.Through some really bad shots that show everything except the murders the cast is thinned out till only the final girl is left to find out Milo\&#39;s dull,I mean dark secret.She and her friends have been dying to know.Once discovered,Milo goes on yet another murderous rampage(isn\&#39;t it his bedtime yet?) and the girl,well she screams a lot.The acting is not even bottom of the barrel,the barrel refuses to be associated with it.Milo can be one creepy bastard from time to time I give him that,but some movies just can\&#39;t be saved without a great script or gratuitous nudity.&#39;

b&#39;I am completely into this type of story line but once the movie fired up, I honestly said out loud, &#34; I just rented a two dollar budget Christian POS&#34;. The only thing I could find to like about this film was it has a descent story but it was awfully executed. Horrible actors, horrible direction and producing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The director and producer need to go watch the cube before trying to pull off a movie in a single room. There was absolutely nothing that kept you intrigued to the point that you didn\&#39;t notice you were in the same room the entire movie. Horrible! The two main actresses were very easy on the eyes and you could tell that was the director counting on to hold your attention. But these two and their bios can speak to this, are horrible in front of the camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t rent this. Unless you are blind, because it might go up a few stars if you only listen to it.&#39;

b&#39;1st watched 10/29/2006 - 4 out of 10(Dir-John Stephenson): Mildly entertaining story of a group of five kids who are forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight &amp; work in World War I as England entered the war. They are told not to go in the greenhouse of the uncle\&#39;s mansion, which of course they do over and over, and they discover a sand fairy who them daily wishes that only last until the sun goes down. This is the &#34;IT&#34; referred to in the title, created by the Jim Henson group and voiced by Eddie Izzard. The problem is their wishes usually bring about other problems that they are supposed to learn from. This part of the movie is not done very well because it\&#39;s obvious the children, primarily the Freddie Highmore character, do not learn from them but instead keep going back to &#34;it&#34; to solve their next big problem. &#34;IT&#34; is not nearly as funny as it could have been with the comedian Eddie Izzard really not given much opportunity to improvise and Kenneth Branagh is wasted as the eccentric uncle, although he is the best character. The children are fine as far as their acting abilities but the story probably would have been much better going into the fantasy realm but they did have a human story to tell as well, which probably caused the confusion with the filmmakers. So, all in all, this was an OK film but could have been much better.&#39;

b&#34;From the dire special effects onwards I was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film. Lets put it this way, I have absolutely no directing experience whatsoever and for the first time ever when watching a film I thought &#39;I can do better than that! whilst sat watching this pap. The acting in this film was terrible, I suppose the best actor was the guy from Lawnmower Man but the French guy from Aliens3 was so wooden I wondered how he got the former job in the first place. The storyline was mediocre and I suppose, like most films, If the rest had been done well it would have stood up. I don&#39;t usually write reviews here but after seeing a couple of people gave this film a good rating (must be cast/crew) I felt I had to say my piece to save anyone from accidentally hiring it or wasting their money on buying this cack.&#34;

b&#39;Usually I\&#39;m the one criticizing the twenty-something Neanderthals for not being able to appreciate a film unless it has plastic t*ts, gunfights and car chases. However, in this case the film might actually have been improved with a few of those additions. At least I wouldn\&#39;t have gotten bored after an hour and changed channels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t mind surreal, and I certainly don\&#39;t mind having to pay attention to find subtlety or hidden meaning, but there should be some point to the whole thing. I didn\&#39;t get the feeling that even the writer or director really had a broad vision of anything but were, instead, just so self-absorbed in their own pretentious visions that they became deliberately scattered. Or perhaps they just got confused themselves. Either way, I don\&#39;t care. It bored the crap out of me for just over an hour with no saving grace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although a whole pack of other viewers have filled up this site with excited ravings about the alleged symbolism and masterful cinematography, I must respectfully disagree. Perhaps I didn\&#39;t mince through enough film classes to appreciate some inspired techniques not visible to mere mortals ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or perhaps this movie was just crap. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a &#34;1&#34; and file it next to &#34;Ishtar.&#34;&#39;

b&#39;Maybe it\&#39;s because I\&#39;m no fan of the comics (but if the comics are of the same &#34;quality&#34; as the movie, it\&#39;s hard to believe there are any), but this has to be one of the worst movies ever made. Non-existent plot, laughable acting, dumb dialogue... This movie is so bad that it hurts. A lot. That some people actually gave this one 10/10 is an insult to any good or at least mediocre (or at least bad) movie. If you hate yourself, then watch Tank Girl! On another thought, if you hate yourself THAT much, maybe you should just commit suicide... My rating: -34/10&#39;

b&#34;I could tell this would be a bad one from the trailer, but the lure of the DVD box got me to rent it anyway. Boy was I right..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for some reason the DVD version is VERY fuzzy and unclear at times (in terms of video quality). It appears as if they shot the whole movie with a 20 year old camcorder, it looks so bad. I really did not like the plot, and after watching the movie I was very let down. I will NOT tell any spoilers, but let it be said that the end was so bad that I laughed, it has been done so many times before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole story seems like something that came out of a middle schooler&#39;s English paper. If I had to peg one movie as the worst horror movie I&#39;ve ever seen, this one may just be it. I can&#39;t believe they actually released this film. It really isn&#39;t worth the rent, or a penny of anyone&#39;s money unless you want a good laugh at the movie&#39;s expense.&#34;

b&#34;&#39;A New Generation&#39; is the third Amityville entry to base its plot around writer John G. Jones&#39;s premise of an item taken from the Long Island house that causes spectral misery and death for its new owners. First a lamp, then a clock, and now a mirror. However, this is also the first Amityville since &#39;The Possession&#39; to directly tie in to the real- life events that started the whole series. This time around, Keyes Terry (Robert Partridge), an artist, is given a macabre-looking mirror by a homeless man one day. Soon enough, people around him start to die, eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the Amityville house - indeed on the very night a man named Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in &#39;Amityville II&#39;) murdered his entire family. Unfortunately for Terry, his discovery of the mirror isn&#39;t entirely coincidental, and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth he&#39;s kept buried since childhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 7th installment in the often worn-out franchise is something of a disappointment for me. Things were starting to pick up with the silly and uneven, yet entertaining &#39;It&#39;s About Time&#39;, and given how much this film tries to draw upon its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - it should have been better than it was. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, three trips to the same well with yet another evil artifact from the Amityville house with yet another explanation for the malign paranormal visitations is wearing on me, to say the least. One of the biggest weaknesses of the Amityville franchise is the steadfast determination by each set of producers to completely ignore every other episode in the series. On the one hand, it&#39;s perfectly reasonable that they don&#39;t want to be tied to someone else&#39;s continuity, but at the very least, they could maybe acknowledge story lines that have already been done and just possibly *not repeat them over and over again*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s also something rather plodding about the way in which the story unfolds, doubtless due to the inevitability this repetition-fest brings. Since you already know what&#39;s going to happen, the carefully-paced build-up is simply slow and tedious. Or maybe it&#39;s just tedious anyway. Director John Murlowski probably could have done more to heighten the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror rather than simply having it flash red and emit chattering &#39;evil&#39; voices, which lacks any kind of subtlety. There were times when characters seemed fairly unfazed by its otherworldly qualities. If they don&#39;t take it too seriously, why should we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is a shame, because &#39;A New Generation&#39; has a more-than-capable cast. I was going to hold off on watching this until I saw the name &#39;Julia Nickson&#39; in the credits. She captivated my attention just as she always does, and if anything, I was annoyed her part wasn&#39;t more extensive. Terry O&#39;Quinn was equally charismatic and again, underused. Partridge himself in the lead role clearly fits the early 90s over-coiffed lumberjack-shirted square-jawed hero type, and while I&#39;m not sure he really gave it the gravitas needed, it&#39;s not as if anyone here is performing Ibsen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sets are also worthy of note, from the dramatic artwork filling Suki&#39;s room, to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashback/supernatural sequences. Getting the look of these right is especially important given how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulated fragmented memories. Clearly, Murlowski is more of a visual director rather than either an actor&#39;s director or one of horror. Unfortunately, it is meant to be a horror film, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;A New Generation&#39; sees the same race being run for the third time in 4 years. Add to this the lack of direction where it was really needed and the whole effort fails to stand as tall as it should. However, it should be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their finest hours. Honestly, the ideal person for this is someone who hasn&#39;t seen any of the sequels past &#39;The Possession&#39;, for whom the story won&#39;t be such a massive deja-vu trip.&#34;

b&#39;Looking back on the year 2006,one of the things i will remember most is the &#34;Snakeamania&#34; on the internet for a film called Snakes on a plane.But unknown to me there was a straight- to- DVD rip-off film called Snakes on a train!After seeing this i feel its at best a below-par B-Movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A husband and wife get on a train to go to Los Angles,to get help form the husbands uncle who is a shaman.This is because the wife\&#39;s family do not approve of her marring him,so they have put a curse on her that snakes will &#34;become her&#34;.Thought with a sixteen hour drive to Los Angles and a group of passengers the include an ex-Narc cop and some drug traffickers.Will they get there in time before the snakes take her over? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;View on the film: First the effects:I have to say that while some scenes with the smaller snakes look good in a gory-way,the main effect shots you have to wait eighty minutes to see!Are sadly that bad that they completely kill any good memories of the film(The film makes 198os Video Games look like T2 next to this!.)One of the things i noticed is that there is no screenplay credit on the film! and the directors make the film so anti-climatic it ruins the whole film. Final view on the film:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A below-par B-Movie,with an unbelievably bad ending.&#39;

b&#34;I just saw this on a local independent station in the New York City area. The cast showed promise but when I saw the director, George Cosmotos, I became suspicious. And sure enough, it was every bit as bad, every bit as pointless and stupid as every George Cosmotos movie I ever saw. He&#39;s like a stupid man&#39;s Michael Bey--with all the awfulness that accolade promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s no point to the conspiracy, no burning issues that urge the conspirators on. We are left to ourselves to connect the dots from one bit of graffiti on various walls in the film to the next. Thus, the current budget crisis, the war in Iraq, Islamic extremism, the fate of social security, 47 million Americans without health care, stagnating wages, and the death of the middle class are all subsumed by the sheer terror of graffiti.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A truly, stunningly idiotic film.&#34;

It comes across as a poorly conceived rip-off of &#34;2001.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing making it worthwhile are the sets and costumes and visual effects.

b&#39;This was included on the disk &#34;Shorts: Volume 2&#34;--a rather dull collection of short films. Shorts are among my favorite style of films but somehow the people assembling this second collection had a hard time finding quality content--and it wasn\&#39;t nearly as good as the first volume or other shorts collections. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This short film feels like it\&#39;s woefully incomplete. There is a story, but so much in unanswered that the viewer, like me, feels a bit left out and unfulfilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film begins with a woman, her boyfriend and her Westie (that\&#39;s a dog, by the way) going to a lonely beach. The lady speaks with an accent that, at times, is a bit difficult to follow. Given that I am hard of hearing, I sure would have loved if it had been closed captioned. Anyway, the boyfriend goes for a swim while she naps. When she awakens, her dog is gone. She panics and makes the guy follow her all about looking for the dog. They spend most of the time arguing and being disagreeable. Then, out of the blue, they stop to have sex. Later, they find the dog--end of story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the characters go, both seemed rather dysfunctional and unlikable. She was a fussy and demanding lady and he seemed to have contempt for her. When you wondered why they were together, their little sex break showed what bond kept them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some might like the characterizations--I kept finding the people irritating and unreal--more like caricatures than people you might meet or know. Also, the payoff for all this just isn\&#39;t worth the wait (unless you want to see the guy naked).&#39;

b&#34;A movie about a French girl who gets raped by street hoodlums. The rape scene itself is shot in all it&#39;s gory detail with all the male and female organs and their interactions clearly visible to the camera. In a fit of rage, the victim grabs her friend&#39;s (or was it brother ?) gun, shoots him and runs off with the weapon. She meets this prostitute who has just seen her pimp shot down, they team up, and make off towards Paris. A series of crazy, meaningless and wild killings follow, the girls seem to enjoy every murder more than the one before. One poor guy gets shot in the ****hole. There are good doses of sex thrown in between the numerous killings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is not the most violent I have seen, I would say Saving Private Ryan probably had more violence in it. If violence is what you are looking for, then there are lots of other movies out there. And if it&#39;s sex you are out for, then I would suggest one of those XXX ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to see the movie because of all the hype the media was giving it. The movie itself is no big deal, just a lot of violence and sex shot with something like a hand-held camera. I was surprised this movie had a 15 year age limit in Sweden, if 15 year-olds can watch this movie, they should be able to watch XXX movies too.&#34;

She&#39;s a politician- she can&#39;t be bogged down by feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story moves slowly and painfully. I was looking at my watch every five minutes wondering when it would be over! The story gets lost in details the director, Sydney Pollack, didn&#39;t need to put in. We don&#39;t want to know about Dutch&#39;s police investigations. They throw in some insight to politicians and the \xc2\x91spin control&#39; they do for campaigns. After seeing the movie I&#39;m still wondering why they got involved romantically. Doesn&#39;t anybody mourn anymore? Don&#39;t you need more than two weeks to even consider going \xc2\x91horizontal&#39; with someone else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was good to see actress, comedian, Chicago native and Second City Alumni Bonnie Hunt.

b&#34;This game is from a genre of games that tried to capitalize off of the whole Myst-inspired trend--walk around, talk to people, solve puzzles. The puzzles themselves are absolutely horrible, but I&#39;ll stick to the acting itself, which is only slightly better. If you&#39;re looking for a convincing performance from any one character, you won&#39;t find it here, but this game is worth buying if only to witness the truly hilarious performance of Christopher Walken. His acting is so horrible in this game that it seems like he&#39;s imitating someone who happens to be impersonating him. He&#39;s a caricature of himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So buy this game if you&#39;re masochistic, a Walken fan, or simply want to hear the F-word a lot.&#34;

b&#39;Is there anything else on earth to be more enticing than to learn what expects our frail bodies after, um, death. Spanish director Ignacio Cerd\xc3\xa0 (a soul-mate of his German colleague J\xc3\xb6rg Buttgereit) provides blow-by-blow answer to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey in the world of preparation tables, scalpels, surgical saws, human entrails and warped minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the autopsy room!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t know which facets of the film, apart of its notorious reputation, may have helped it to acquire sufficiently high rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storywise it\&#39;s fairly simple and straightforward - a day in the life (actually half an hour) of a troubled coroner (or, perhaps, assistant pathologist or whoever he is) that is fed up with his routine morbid duty and discharges his psychological tension in a non-traditional fashion, right at his workplace. I\&#39;m perplexed of what particular message the authors tried to deliver with this one-note plot. I suspect it may be somehow inspired by Udo Kier\&#39;s character\&#39;s quirky demeanor in Andy Warhol\&#39;s Frankenstein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Artistic values of the film are also questionable. It\&#39;s hard to evaluate the performance of the actors that don\&#39;t squeeze a single word. Their emotions are concealed behind the medical masks. There\&#39;s also not enough room for great camera-work - basically, the entire action unfolds mostly within four walls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Authenticity - effects and makeup are impressive and the setup looks very plausible, but only a handful of medical/forensic experts can judge how truthful and anatomically correct the dissection is carried out here (if anyone cares). Honestly, I used to think that the autopsy is done to examine the condition of particular organs and to ascertain the cause of death. Now I know that dead bodies are severed, raped and humiliated, intestines are ripped apart, brains are retrieved from the head, stuffed into abdomen and mixed with guts, then the body is stitched back and washed - nothing personal. And what are these poor lads expected to write in their deceitful autopsy reports afterward?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shock and disgust factor - it\&#39;s much unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer would discover, to his horror, that the disc he was intended to watch with his wife and kids beside a Christmas tree turns out to be a graphic video manual on vivisection. This obscure item is barely available, sought by people well familiar with the subject and not easily offended. Hence it would be pointless to warn anyone to sabotage this film. They are well aware what exactly they are watching and what they want to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cerd\xc3\xa0 is really gifted and stylish director, which is clearly obvious from at least two other parts of his &#34;trilogy&#34; - preceding \&#39;The Awakening\&#39;, amazing black and white short, and 30-minute \&#39;Genesis\&#39;, visually stunning and moody piece with an off-beat and interesting concept. And I\&#39;m pretty sure that one day he will conquer the hearts of moviegoers with his new, more mainstream oriented, material. And sooner or later \&#39;Aftermath\&#39; would become a rarity for the meticulous collectors of his &#34;early&#34; &#34;warm-up&#34; works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the meantime, I\&#39;m afraid, it may be recommended strictly for medical students or specialists that study mental disorders and sexual deviations.&#39;

b&#34;This movie makes you wish imdb would let you vote a zero. One of the two movies I&#39;ve ever walked out of. It&#39;s very hard to think of a worse movie with such big name actors. Well...Armageddon almost takes it, but not quite.&#34;

b&#34;Spoilers!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate this one, but it is better than the others after this, they just keep getting worse. I hope Gibson has the smarts to stay out of the next one. A lot of the same with humor, ie the toilet, kids, etc. How much farther can we watch their relationship evolve. Drugs, bad guys why South Africa! I found that unbelievable, maybe South American, some country in the Golden Triangle would have made the script better. It seems the late 80&#39; early 90&#39;s had the blond bad guys ie Die Hard, the mighty Ducks play Ice Land Gary Busey in the last Weapon, etc. Hollywood repeats itself over. This one with a similar story has to go over the top. The attacking the police, the beach condo scene, and the fight at the end, and way over the top Gibson&#39;s girlfriend killed by the copper attack were too much. Like many part 2&#39;s, they get worse, and 3 or 4 in this series picks up speed downhill. 3/10&#34;

b&#39;I did my best to watch this two hour fiasco. It combined the awful special effects and plot of the original &#34;Blob,&#34; with an execrable boosting of the (outstanding in the original) screenplay of &#34;Runaway Train.&#34; The only explanation for this movie is that someone needed to take a huge tax deduction and figured they\&#39;d combine it with a shot at hosting a casting couch. What an incredible stinker! Lou Diamond Phillips is anxious to show us why he will take any part, no matter how bad. Barry Corbin continues his career as a typecast creep, a U.S. Senator from Texas and plays it well. He should next do the lead role in the story of Trent Lott or Jesse Helms. The women in this flick all seem to have gotten their roles as consolation prizes in the Fay Wray Memorial screaming contest. Special effects are unbelievably bad. H.S. kids in film class in North Dakota could have done a better job. The writers must have pulled a heist at the clich\xc3\xa9 bank to accumulate this many. I couldn\&#39;t watch any more without being forced to sit in the Clockwork Orange chair. I have no idea how it ended, except obviously, 119 minutes too late. Ugh! Caveat emptor.&#39;

b&#34;Navy Seals is an ignorant, racist and complacent movie which thoughtlessly uses the Middle East conflict as the backdrop for an action flick concocted for a comfortably sheltered American Mid-West audience. The conflict, as well as those involved, is used simply as cannon fodder to glorify the photogenic young Americans who proudly kill Arabs for the good of &#39;freedom&#39;. But what is worse is that the film&#39;s action scenes are sloppily handled and unexciting, which prevents Navy Seals from working even as a mindless shoot-&#39;em-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Sheen&#39;s character (Hawkins) is disgusting, obnoxious, ignorant, reckless and, above all, racist. He refers to the Middle East as a &#39;s**t-hole&#39; and to its inhabitants as &#39;rag-heads&#39;. Throughout the film, the Navy Seals&#39; characters are glorified through the use of the Lebanese natives as cannon fodder. They indiscriminately massacre these people with a consequence-free attitude. There is even the tasteless murder of a young Lebanese boy who is shot by Hawkins; Hawkins makes fun of his language before shooting him whilst making another humorous quip. Besides being tasteless, this should be unacceptable. The film&#39;s extreme (though predictable)pro-American stance is also revolting. This can be seen when the Lebanese-American female journalist informs Hawkins that terrorists cant be made to talk because &#39;they are religious zealots.&#39; Hawkins then retorts with &#39;yeah, and we are the Navy Seals!&#39; The implication is obviously that zealots are meaningless next to American military might. Moreover, even after insulting this journalist&#39;s racial heritage and treating her like a sex object, the script demands her inability to resist this disgusting thug and she still ends up sleeping with him - because he is an All-American Navy Seal. This marginalizes the journalist&#39;s character by making her submissive to the &#39;superior&#39; pro-American attitude of Hawkins despite his insulting behaviour toward her. Beyond ethics, this plot twist also has little credence as drama. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The screenplay is also amateurish. Most scenes are simply strung together without any thought for mood, plot or character development. The &#39;music video&#39; scene at the golf course, for example is just shoddily edited eye candy. And the two scenes where Charlie Sheen plays the reckless hero are also pointless. In one he jumps off a bridge from moving car just to show his mates how tough he is, and in the other he chases down a tow truck on a push bike and drives his car-off it. Neither scene has a follow-up anti-climax, both are highly improbable, and neither has any bearing on the plot as a whole. They are just candy designed as a vehicle to showcase Hawkins&#39; cheap all-American heroics, and are poor substitutes for character development. Most of the other plot development scenes are also badly filmed and poorly scripted as - in fact this affliction affects the entire movie. Apart from the African American Navy Seal and his wife as well as the characters of Michael Biehn and Charlie Sheen, every other member of the team seems unknown to the audience, so that when the climatic scenes roll around there seems to nobody to root for and anybody&#39;s death to lament.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In such a film, the action sequences can potentially rescue the production. But here they don&#39;t. These are badly directed, badly lit, and showcase badly performed stunts. In fact, their direction is so poor that they are almost incoherent to the viewer, resulting in not only the scenes being incomprehensibly hard to follow, but also in a complete lack of fear and suspense. Poor lighting only adds to their impotence. The explosions look fake, gunshot wounds unconvincing and one of the more daring stunts, involving crashing a Mercedes over a tank, looks just like a stunt which has been staged on a backlot and then poorly edited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending of Navy Seals places the coins firmly on the eyes of this production. First there is the obligatory slow-motion &#39;running-away-from-the-big-explosion-that-should-have-killed-me&#39; scene with Sheen carrying Biehn on his back. This was obviously the default scene intended to be the star of the movie&#39;s trailers. Then there is the ending itself when the remaineder of the Seal team, wounded and floating in the ocean, are rescued by a submarine. This submarine had in fact turned for home long before, but of course it had miraculously returned in the nick of time. Topping it all of, despite the Seals&#39; violent and stressful ordeal, and despite the fact that numerous of their colleagues had just been killed, with a number of them still bleeding acutely, they all manage to laugh heartily while blessing America vociferously. Predictable? You can just imagine this ending while watching the opening credits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie indulgently uses the Middle Eastern conflict as a vehicle for the macho All-American tendencies of the movies&#39; photogenic young leads. Arabs are treated condescendingly and dismissively, and their slaughter in the movie is used as a fulcrum to glorify the use of American military might against an &#39;inferior&#39; minority group in a consequence-free environment. The events of 2001 have pointed out that such smug and overconfident trivialising of the conflicts of such minority groups is certainly not a consequence free passtime. The Middle East can no longer be written off as a s**t-hole full of rag heads knocking each other off (to quote Charlie Sheen here); it is now a place in which involvement can lead to severe consequences. Today we are reminded that the consequences of such arrogance can manifest themselves quite close to home. Therefore, in the very least Navy Seals looks pretty foolish these days; but this is to be kind. This is a highly ignorant movie, whose production values and professionalism are equally suspect. Navy Seals is, ideologically and artistically, a complete insult to the intelligence of its audience.&#34;

b&#34;Now, I am going to do this without putting spoilers if I can. My cousin and I were renting movies the other weekend, and we stumbled across this, with the big freaking&#39; scarecrow on the cover. It looked cool, so we rented it alongside Kungfu Hustle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow... Just... Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start off, the movie was horrible. Now, the box art, opening scenes, and music was decent-to-well done, but the movie itself is horrendous. The acting is sub-par (Sean, the lead, shows hardly any emotion and/or effort in his character), the scarecrows look nothing like the one on the cover (False advertising, perhaps?), and the camera shots and angles were that of a bad wrestling event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And trust me, I&#39;m a wrestling fan. I KNOW bad camera angles. And honestly, this is right up there with Gigli and Pootie Tang. It&#39;s done so bad that it AMUSES me. It makes me laugh. So, somehow, this movie takes its place as a good comedy to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, to be fair, it does serve as a what to do and what not to do in movies, especially of the slasher genre. I recommend that people DO watch this, just to get a good grasp of what to avoid.&#34;

b&#39;Despite John Travolta\&#39;s statements in interviews that this was his favorite role of his career, &#34;Be Cool&#34; proves to be a disappointing sequel to 1995\&#39;s witty and clever &#34;Get Shorty.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travolta delivers a pleasant enough performance in this mildly entertaining film, but ultimately the movie falls flat due to an underdeveloped plot, unlikeable characters, and a surprising lack of chemistry between leads Travolta and Uma Thurman. Although there are some laughs, this unfunny dialog example (which appeared frequently in the trailers) kind of says it all: Thurman: Do you dance? Travolta: Hey, I\&#39;m from Brooklyn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film suggests that everyone in the entertainment business is a gangster or aspires to be one, likening it to organized crime. In &#34;Get Shorty,&#34; the premise of a gangster &#34;going legitimate&#34; by getting into movies was a clever fish-out-of water idea, but in &#34;Be Cool,&#34; it seems the biz has entirely gone crooked since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is interestingly casted and the absolute highlight is a &#34;monolgue&#34; delivered by The Rock, whose character is an aspiring actor as well as a goon, where he reenacts a scene between Gabrielle Union and Kirsten Dunst from &#34;Bring It On.&#34; Vince Vaughan\&#39;s character thinks he\&#39;s black and he\&#39;s often seen dressed as a pimp-- this was quite funny in the first scene that introduces him and gets tired and embarrassing almost immediately afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, &#34;Be Cool&#34; may be worth a rental for John Travolta die-hards (of which I am one), but you may want to keep your finger close to the fast forward button to get through it without feeling that you wasted too much time. Fans of &#34;Get Shorty&#34; may actually wish to avoid this, as the sequel is devoid of most things that made that one a winner. I rate this movie an admittedly harsh 4/10.&#39;

b&#39;Bad script? Check. Awful effects? Check. Horrible actors? Check. Lame direction? Check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing the DVD box at blockbuster video and being a fan of the horror genre, I placed my $4.28 on the line and rented this &#34;film.&#34; My girlfriend was out of town and I was bored so on a late Tuesday night I decided this would be a perfect time for me to watch, what appeared to be (based on the box cover art) a horror movie. What I got instead was the worst film ever made. Up until that point I had always declared &#34;Slumber Party Massacre 3&#34; the worst film ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are the type that wants to see a movie because you heard how bad it is, this is for you. If you don\&#39;t want to lose $4.00 and 80 irreplaceable minutes of your life, steer clear of this garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added note: I noticed a few of the &#34;actors&#34; come on here and post comments on the bulletin board. How can you brag about being in this film? You were all horrible. I mean really bad. If there was an American Idol for actors, you all would be laughed at in the first few episodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sutter Cain&#39;

b&#34;Committed stars (Heather Graham) along with (Casey Affleck) and (Luke Wilson). Its the story of Joline who is determined to find her ex-husband who is in the process of a mid-life crisis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Committed was not at all what I expected it was lacking in comedy which was ultimately the genre. It was beyond stupid and un-realistic, Casey Affleck delivered a reasonable performance, Graham&#39;s recent roles have been lack-luster and this is not an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Graham&#39;s most recent role was Blessed which I also found misleading and didn&#39;t appeal to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros Affleck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons Predictable, Unrealistic, Poor Acting and not a comedy movie!&#34;

b&#34;I could not watch more than 10 minutes of this movie. It has set the standard. I will never again give a movie a 1, unless it was as horrible as this one. I fully agree with the other comments about this film. But, since I&#39;m Dutch, I watched it with Dutch translation. Apparently, they didn&#39;t have money for a proper translation, so they decided to babelfish it. With sometimes hilarious results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t smoke, don&#39;t drink, don&#39;t do drugs, don&#39;t watch Demon Summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that the actors (Wow, I can&#39;t believe I just said that.) didn&#39;t hold the script (Was there any?) in their hands while shooting. I think they also did a good job on... Well... Uhmm... No, they didn&#39;t do a good job at all.&#34;

b&#39;I rented this movie because it supposedly takes place in a jazz club -- you know, those hip, cool places you might stumble upon late on a Saturday night. Well, there\&#39;s not one ounce of &#34;cool&#34; in this ridiculous movie. The score is goofy, the original songs are awful, both lead actors\&#39; singing is continually off-key (to be kind) and unprofessional at best, the plot is no more complex than &#34;boy meets girl,&#34; the acting is laughable, and the only decent cinematic moments are the stock footage scenes. The jazz club scenes feature sophomoric dialog smothered by overly-busy organ music. This Joey de Francesco should keep his day job (unless his day job is helping with movie scores). Is it possible to not only get my four dollars back, but have my therapy sessions paid for as well? This movie, interestingly enough, is so bad, you might want to watch it. Sort of like driving by a bad accident -- you just have to look at least once. Just get the ear plugs ready!&#39;

b&#39;This film is by far the worst film I have ever seen in my life. A woman &#34;The EX&#34; pretends to be a number of people in order to gain access to her ex-husband. Killing people for no- reason in baths to achieve her goal. The women I don\&#39;t think ever went to acting college. She just spends the whole film making stupid expressions, and she looks like she is trying her absolute hardest to avoid looking into the camera. Failing on most occasions. She makes friends with her Ex Husband\&#39;s wife and son, she does this to use them against her husband. At first when you watch this film, you think that the &#34;Ex&#34; wants to kill her ex-husband, maybe because he has treated her in a bad way. But in fact the women is obsessed with the man and wants him back. The two of them used to enjoy rough entertainment (using whips of course). My advice to the general public is do not buy this film, do not rent this film and do not watch it like I did (at 1.15am on FOX)&#39;

b&#34;A couple of men are ship-wrecked on a remote island. They are then captured by an insane count who lives there with a small group of servants; while in the castle dungeon lives the count&#39;s unfortunate leper wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dungeon of Harrow is pretty much a hack job of a movie. The amateur actors all sleepwalk through the film while an annoyingly insistent score continually plays in the background. The various bits of action are all filmed in an incredibly unenergetic way; in fact the film in general is completely lethargic. It just seems to drag on and on. And even though the ending isn&#39;t too bad you will be hard-pressed to care by that point. As an example of 60&#39;s Gothic horror, this is strictly a bargain basement example. I sadly can&#39;t recommend this one really.&#34;

b&#39;Roll up! Roll up! It\&#39;s Big Gay Bruce and his Big Gay Death Cannon! Plausible plot? Unnecessary! Decent acting? Unnecessary! Respect shown to its mighty progenitor? Unnecessary! Yes it\&#39;s another offensively stuffed turkey in the Butch Bruce canon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean where do you start with this film? Okay, let\&#39;s begin with the woeful misapprehension people might have that this was, in some way, related to either the book or the original film, The Day of the Jackal. It\&#39;s not. In fact it\&#39;s so different (and so bad) that Fredrick Forsyth asked to have his name taken off it. Now I\&#39;m not necessarily a stuffy Brit who can\&#39;t hack Hollywood remaking British films. Well, okay, maybe I am a bit like that, but fortunately it\&#39;s a redundant point in this case. This film is so different to the original that the name and the odd reference are the only things that survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let\&#39;s move to the premise. Cheesy Russian gangster gets killed in a Moscow police raid (somehow involving the FBI although no one bothers to explain why). In revenge, brother of gangster decides to wreak vengeance by killing the wife of the US President (although again no one bothers to explain why this is a good move \xc2\x96 although to be fair it was pre-9-11, so he wasn\&#39;t to know it would have resulted in the US airforce carpet bombing Eastern Europe). Gangster hires &#34;nasty&#34; killer (Willis). Police hire &#34;cuddly&#34; killer (Gere), &#34;cuddly&#34; killer tracks &#34;nasty&#34; killer. Police fanny around and periodically get killed. &#34;Cuddly&#34; killer kills &#34;nasty&#34; killer. First lady is saved and we all realise that the IRA are just this bunch of real sweet guys y\&#39;know, who just happen to want to kill innocent people. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s put to one side the distasteful Hollywood habit of playing in the troubles of Northern Ireland like it was a sandpit in a theme park (I deal with this point more extensively on the message boards). If Hollywood directors want to cast the Belfast butchers as hookers with hearts of gold, that\&#39;s up to them. I, of course, reserve the right to despise them for it. It\&#39;s a free country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More egregious, however, is the fact that the film manages to patronise and insult the Irish while trying to support them. That\&#39;s not politically distasteful, it\&#39;s far worse: it\&#39;s incompetent. It\&#39;s no wonder, for instance, that Gere still looks so damn good, given that he slept through the entire six months it took to make this piece of cra*p. The fact that Gere\&#39;s accent is not only Southern Irish, but an appalling parody of Southern Irish shows that the filmmakers weren\&#39;t looking much beyond America to make money from this film. Then there is that lovely scene at the end where Sidney Poitier (a complete waste of space in this film) says he\&#39;s off for a coffee, offers to get our &#34;cuddly&#34; IRA man one, then casually says &#34;Ah, but then you guys drink Guinness don\&#39;t you&#34;. Yeah that\&#39;s right Sidney; the Irish live on Guinness and potatoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we\&#39;re on the subject of Poitier: why? In the original film the detective is the tracker. In Jackal, Gere is the tracker. So what does Poitier do? Well, he just hangs around and looks like a tw*at of course. He\&#39;s got absolutely nothing to do apart from call in the marines at the end, and he only does this because the nice IRA man tells him to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we\&#39;re on the subject of Gere: why? I suppose it\&#39;s only a matter of time before Hollywood remakes Gandhi with Vin Diesel playing ex-Mujahideen Commando Mahatma Gandhi beheading his way through 1940s and 50s India (he is, after all, a bit dark of hue and therefore very likely to be a Muslim fundamentalist). Let\&#39;s not forget that Gere\&#39;s character is a killer and therefore a nasty piece of work. And if he\&#39;s not, why does he know The Jackal? If he\&#39;s not, why does he know all his moves? And if he is, why is he such a limp biscuit and such a &#34;loveable&#34; person? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this goes to show that the makers of this film couldn\&#39;t be bothered to (a) think about the plot (b) have the characters making decisions that were in keeping with their character(c) avoid cheesy stereotypes like having the big boss bad guy kill his own friend \xc2\x96 I honestly thought this had turned into a Bond movie (d) give the &#34;central&#34; characters something to do (e) credit the audience with a modicum of intelligence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is an insult to the British and Irish killed at the hands of terrorists, it\&#39;s an insult to the Irish people, it\&#39;s an insult to not great, but pretty good film it rips off, and an insult to the intelligence. But most of all \xc2\x96 and most unforgivable \xc2\x96 it is an insult to my a*rse for having to sit through the over two hours of run time it took to finish. Honestly, you\&#39;d think with no plot, no characters and no dialogue, it would be over in no time. But they didn\&#39;t even have the decency to quit early.&#39;

This is one of Johnny Depp&#39;s worst movies- I highly discourage anyone from watching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you must see Cry-Baby though, I recommend muting it and simply ogling at Mr. Depp for and hour and a half.&#34;

b&#34;I thought this would be funny. I did. I don&#39;t know what happened. But I think a lot of the problem unfortunately falls with the casting. I don&#39;t know who this kid is, he could be a very nice person but he wasn&#39;t right for this movie. And the supporting cast was great which only makes it more obvious. For example there would be a scene with him and his love interest and your mind just starts to wander off but then Keith David starts speaking, or Leslie Nielsen, or Marion Ross, and it&#39;s like someone turned a light on and suddenly you can pay attention again and you think it might not be that bad. But when they get back to the main characters the lights go out again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spoofing material available in the superhero genre is plentiful so the fact that most of the jokes were basically a fart, makes you wonder who wrote this thing. I mean it had a couple of funny bits, as I do remember laughing a couple of times, but right now I don&#39;t remember why and it was only a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really I&#39;m giving it a take it or leave it rating but I think most people should just leave it.&#34;

b&#34;The Comebacks is a spoof on inspirational sports movies, and let me just tell you-it is not a good one. Tom Brady (the director) probably found it hilarious that referencing sports films (from Gridiron Gang, Invincible and even Miracle! to The Longest Yard and Dodgeball-yes Dodgeball!) and tossing in a couple of sex jokes, would be the funniest thing since Airplane! Well, he was wrong. They did such a slipshod job, you&#39;d thought it was written in a week. I have found it that if a director loves the genre, the movie will be good. Obviously, Brady does not love the genre he is spoofing. This movie is a rancid piece of garbage not worth viewing, so don&#39;t see it!&#34;

The storyline is completely &#34;retarted&#34;, my 5 year old cousin could probably write a better script. I don\&#39;t understand how someone could fund the production of a film like this ... horrible. This is definitely the shittiest most horrid movie i\&#39;ve ever seen in my entire existence. I think the casting director just took some random kids from off the street to act in this movie. The directing, acting, producing and writing for this film are all really bad.

b&#34;This movie was completely stale and uninspired. The central premise of this movie was basically a bunch of stereotypical black people sitting around a barbershop exchanging painfully unfunny repartee. I did not laugh one time during the entire movie. I could have sat in any barbershop in America and have heard this banal banter, and maybe have even come out with a decent haircut. I cannot understand why this mess got any favourable reviews, much less why so many people have wasted money on this. None of the characters here were funny or worth caring about. I really didn&#39;t care whether the rival barbershop across the street would cause Nappy Cutz to go out of business. Don&#39;t waste your money on this one, folks, as that is the only way to get Hollywood to stop churning out these shambolic pieces of rubbish. 1* out of 5&#34;

b&#34;I began watching this movie on t.v. some weeks ago, but gave up after the first 10 minutes or so.

b&#39;&#34;Tamara&#34; just felt like another teen oriented knock-off of the &#34;I Know What You Did Last Summer&#34; trend and is painfully dull. A high school outcast, who is heavily into witchcraft and black magic, is accidentally killed during a cruel prank carried out by a group of bullies who secretly bury her in the woods, vowing to tell no one. The next day, the supposedly &#34;dead&#34; Tamara, arrives at school with a completely new image and seduces her would-be killers and has a little revenge... This is basically a combination of &#34;Carrie&#34;, &#34;The Craft&#34;, and every other straight-to-video, teeny bopper turkey that hits the shelves these days. The actors are absolutely atrocious and look about ten years too old to pass off as high schoolers.

b&#39;Terrible direction from an awful script. Even the DVD looked muddy and out of focus. Laughable accents all over the map. Unlike most of the other commenters I had no idea this was about boys in love in the mud, but that fact became immediately obvious from the opening scene and all the lovingly drawn-out shots of nude or scantily-clad young men, usually wet or glistening with sweat, looking longingly at each other.&#39;

b&#34;This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: Do nothing, be a loser and then suddenly... whoah! You&#39;re a genius and an obnoxious one and the world is kissing the ground you are walking on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And surprisingly all the other smart people are losers. They don&#39;t know anything and are bitter when our wonderkid solves problems so easily. And what kind of problems? They are so difficult but still these professors can analyse the results in less than 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every movie has something good in it anyway and Robin Williams is it in this one.&#34;

b&#34;Well, to each his own, but I thought Gibson&#39;s Hamlet was the most god-awful rendition I had ever witnessed... as subtly nuanced as a paper bag, and as inspired as a telemarketing call. The only reason I watched the movie through to the end was that I held out hope that either it would get better or become unintentionally funny. No luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No disrespect for the supporting cast or for Zefferelli&#39;s staging, but nothing can make up for the bungling of the main character. I have seen Hamlet well-portrayed as an African prince, as an animated lion, as a rough-and-tumble warrior, as a romantic poet, etc. etc. etc. . But IMHO this portrayal was just a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams.&#34;

b&#39;Why remake the original &#34;Assault&#34;? To my mind &#34;Assault&#34; was Carpenter\&#39;s true masterpiece. It had all the elements good Carpenter movies contain. External threat on a small group of individuals. People taking the challenge because they are forced to do so. Isolation! Just remember, the guns in Carpenter\&#39;s original made no sound, being thus a lot more threatening than conventional devices. And now this remake. Concentrating on &#34;main character I&#34;s psychology and on his relation to main character II (the evil but honorable). The anonymous threat in the Carpenter movie replaced by a rather conventional conspiracy/corruption background. The &#34;remakers&#34; just didn\&#39;t understand the main plot of the original. And thus produced something pretty ordinary.&#39;

b&#39;I know curiosity killed the cat, but I simply had to see the remake of Psycho, especially after being on such a Hitchcok journey recently and knowing his work. I\&#39;ve watched the original Psycho though since I was a kid, I knew how to respect it and not only that, it was an excellent movie! One of the best, in fact! The first thing I said when I heard about the remake was &#34;How do you remake perfection?&#34;. I stuck to that as well, but I think I have a more open mind now and figured maybe it was a way of introducing Psycho to a new generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this turned into a total insult and slap to the face of the original Psycho. I know this has been said, but I watched the making of this film, and the director was like &#34;Oh, I just want to update it and shoot each scene shot by shot like the original&#34;... what\&#39;s the friggin\&#39; point?! OK, but I want to judge this movie on it\&#39;s own, despite it\&#39;s insulting blows the original. I mean, the acting wasn\&#39;t up to par, but honestly, it looked like the actors just watched the original and just memorized the lines from there and made it their crappy own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching the making of this film, I wanted to slap Anne Hasche, she said &#34;I\&#39;ve never seen the original, I just wanted to work with Gus.&#34; Ooh, that made me angry, because frankly, it\&#39;s not just that, she really sucked in this role as Marian, she wasn\&#39;t convincing, not to mention her shower scene really was horrible. Vince Vaughn didn\&#39;t make... let\&#39;s just put it this way, the film was horribly miscasted. This was a sin against film and on it\&#39;s own, this was actually a bad movie. It was too much and destroyed what could\&#39;ve been a new introduction for a new generation. But to Gus, leave the film making the one\&#39;s who KNOW WHAT THEY\&#39;RE DOING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/10&#39;

b&#39;I always think it would be nice if you could somehow have a \&#39;sneak preview\&#39; at some of the old movies that are re-released on DVD, before you purchase them. That way you could save yourself some time, money and a certain degree of aggro when you feel so utterly let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Buddy Holly Story&#34; is such a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not wish to go into the characterizations, or the holes in the plot, or the messing around with historical facts that this movie encompasses, for I had already come to terms with them twenty years ago, when I first began watching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had recorded it on the old (Monaural) Beta machine back in the early 1980s, and liked it so much, that it became a regularly-played favourite. The best part, to my mind, was Gary Busey\&#39;s performance as the young Buddy, and his near-perfect vocals and guitar playing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked forward to the day when I could have it in ...STEREO..., and that is where the disappointment comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This DVD version is (supposedly) re-mastered in both audio and video, according to the shell information, but I\&#39;m afraid it left me sadly let-down and glancing at my watch, wishing for it to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound is murky, bordering on the unintelligible, and so unprofessionally mixed that it had me yearning for the crystal-clarity vocals of my old Beta tape! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite what you think of the images, or the plot, or the characters, the real draw card here is the MUSIC......and if you can\&#39;t hear the lead vocals because they are drowned out by the cymbals, or the backing harmonies, or other ambients, then there\&#39;s not much left, is there? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m going to convert my old Beta version to (Mono) DVD for subsequent viewings, and put this one where it belongs, out with the rubbish! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Extinction is the Rule, Survival is the Exception...&#34;&#39;

b&#34;Conclusion: very, but very, very boring, yet I watched till the end, hoping for some upside-down effect, but the end was worse, because it was nothing. The old black&amp;white game didn&#39;t helped at all, it usually helps psychological movies, but this was not the case. The script, the plot, etc were linear, had no substance, nothing in-going. When you deal with psychological, you deal with analysis, therefore with details, that unity-diversity formula....there was no essence, no detail. Just a story, there are many stories to tell, but something makes them unique and hard to forgive with the tools and creativity of movie-makers...well, this is not the one.&#34;

b&#34;This was a mish mash of a film that started out going nowhere, got lost on the way then suddenly found a plot in the last 5 minutes when the title character is FINALLY introduced. There were so many ugly, mutton-chopped guys in this film, I lost track of who was the owner and who were the overseers. I have a theory about the casting though; all the bad guys were played by ugly actors (and one ugly actress) and all the good guys/victims were played by beautiful actors. Indeed the actors who played the ultimate victims, the slaves, were gorgeous as was the innocent priest&#39;s daughter, while the plantation owner, his minipulative mistress and his overseers were pretty hard on the eyes. On purpose? You make the call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hung in there till the end and some others might be able to make it as well. If you just want to look at bare breasts, there are plenty of them here and if you have a slave/master fetish then you&#39;ll love this film. Otherwise, watch it once, vomit, shower and never speak of it to anyone.&#34;

b&#39;Brainless film about two girls and some guys they meet in an airport getting on the wrong late night shuttle bus and ending up in a whole world of trouble. Great twists and turns are totally, and I do mean totally wasted, in a film with a plot so incredibly stupid as to defy description. What is going on in a general sense is okay, I mean the idea of a guy kidnapping unattended girls for nefarious purposes is a good one. The problem is that the details are so beyond belief that I would be shocked if you don\&#39;t turn off the film in utter disbelief. Gee, a guy who is suppose to be taking you home doesn\&#39;t go any of the ways you know, and you stay on the bus? It get worse from there, think of every bad choice and this film has the characters make it, even to the point where they could just walk away, but never do. Whats annoying is that some of the twists and turns might have worked if there was something intelligent before it, but there is almost no intelligence anywhere in this film. Okay, maybe there is, the end, the end is clever. The end is the sort of thing that should freak you out. it should be the &#34;oh #$*@!!!!&#34; moment and become a classic of horror cinema. Instead it just lies there among the stupid ruins of a stupid movie. One of the most brainless films of the year.&#39;

b&#34;Some may go for a film like this but I most assuredly did not. A college professor, David Norwell, suddenly gets a yen for adoption. He pretty much takes the first child offered, a bad choice named Adam. As it turns out Adam doesn&#39;t have both oars in the water which, almost immediately, causes untold stress and turmoil for Dr. Norwell. This sob story drolly played out with one problem after another, all centered around Adam&#39;s inabilities and seizures. Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained. Along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out. Personally, I think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack. Bypass this yawner.&#34;

b&#39;I am furious! It has been a while since the last zombie movie I\&#39;ve watched so I was really looking forward to watching a good ol\&#39; gory zombie movie. HoTD2 was a major disappointment. A reasonable story but awful acting, filming, dialogue, and nauseating clich\xc3\xa9s and punch lines. I didn\&#39;t even see the first one which is supposedly worse than this one...now I am curious about how bad could that one have been! The film is full of mistakes and goofs. Who on earth analyses DNA using a blood sample!? Why are these &#34;special forces&#34; who &#34;have been to hell and back&#34; fight like spoiled 6 year old girls? We see ferocious zombies who would take a bite at any chance they get then hundreds of them that wave their arms at our two &#34;heroes&#34;, take them down to the ground, then let them go without even a scratch. I could go on and on about this but life is too short and I have already wasted a couple of hours watching this pathetic movie which is an insult to the movie industry.&#39;

b&#39;I bought this film on DVD despite the &#34;stale&#34; review and that was idiotic... That review was completely accurate and I have never seen any worse &#34;erotic&#34; film in my long life! Even if it partly was lovely filmed and had interesting surroundings, plus a nice cover... But my own Extreme Erotica (c) films are over 100 times more erotic (just in the soft delicious aspect) with probably less than 100 times of this films budget! The story have no logical connection with the first film or the famous book... Or any new (exciting) element of slave training, except some very strange and sad developments... Then did the main male character - Klaus Kinski - not look a bit like the second Master of &#34;O&#34; he try to play... And not even lovely Arielle Dombasle, did look delicious in any scene!&#39;

b&#34;This takes place on Fire Island back in the 1970s. A couple Peter (Craig Dudley) and Buddy (J. Will Deane) are throwing a 4th of July party at their house. Unfortunately their relationship is falling apart and they have to get ready for a house full of very strange guests. The rest of the movie chronicles the party and what happens between Peter and Buddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK--I&#39;m a gay man but I was 8 back when this was made. If this is a true view of what gay life was in the 1970s, I&#39;m glad I wasn&#39;t around. From the puzzling opening credits which shows kids playing in the sand (???) this movie slides slowly into disaster. There&#39;s a guru (Robert Case) who talks nonstop about nothing of any importance. I wanted to gag the guy halfway into his first LONG speech. There&#39;s the young kid Danny who is there for his first time. There&#39;s the lesbian couple (who do nothing--except one strips for no reason). There&#39;s the leather queen. Worst of all is the effeminate man named Jimmy (Jimmy Foster). We&#39;re introduced to him and his friend (whose name I never got) when they get a flat tire. They basically scream and screech for 10 minutes and have NO idea how to fix a flat. I know some people find this funny but I found it offensive and pretty sad. The party itself is full of people you would never want to know. It&#39;s like being dumped in a party full of bad actors playing obnoxious people. With the sole exception of Dudley no one can act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be valuable as a portrait of what Fire Island was like in the 1970s...but it&#39;s pretty dull viewing. This gets a 2 only for the frequent male nudity of some very nice bodies.&#34;

Do yourself a big favor and don&#39;t waste your money on this, don&#39;t waste anyone&#39;s money on this. I gave it a 1/10 believe me I would have given it less if I could have.

b&#34;And obviously I didn&#39;t see it! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But looking at the cast and seeing that Doug Masters is back from the dead, I know now to avoid this like the plague! I hate it when Hollywood, producers, writers, directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that they&#39;re not going to catch continuity errors. A supposedly dead Doug Masters returning is a big giant one, won&#39;t you say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I can&#39;t believe that someone like Louis Gossett, Jr. would return for something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did Jason Gedrick really decline this? Well, I hate to say it, but even if he took the role again, it would have still had that same continuity error. I bet (if he really turned it down), he must have been incredulous seeing that his character died in the second film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll probably catch it by accident on a late night air on some channel, but no way am I going to rent this or buy the DVD!&#34;

b&#39;First, the current IMDb plot description seems to be misleading, the movie is about a group of girls who pick up a misogynistic hitchhiker, who plans to kill them all. They stop at a small motel, where he holds them hostage, but develops an intense attraction for one of the girls. Violence ensues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up by mistake thinking it was the other 2007 movie &#34;The Hitcher&#34;. Not that The Hitcher is any better, and I was looking for a crummy movie to watch anyway, but this was almost unbearable at times. I think I could have vomited on a piece of paper and come up with a better plot than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can\&#39;t even count how many movies I\&#39;ve seen with virtually the same storyline, so this was almost painfully predictable at times, but what really made it awful were a few scenes that ... well let me give an example. At one point a door is covered in (what is very obviously) blood, and two police officers, at the scene because of a 911 call, are looking at it from 30 feet away, see a man, also covered in blood, walk out of the door, agree that it looks suspicious, but decide to not investigate further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, however ridiculous it may be, the movie was never boring, was well produced, directed, and acted, complete with good special effects, gratuitous nudity, and violence. I probably would not recommend actually spending 90 minutes of your life sitting down to watch this movie, but it turned out to be perfect to have on while I cleaned my basement. Also highly recommended for fans of crummy movies, and would be a good movie to watch with friends when you plan on doing more talking than watching.&#39;

b&#34;I saw this movie in Blockbuster and thought it might be a good Sunday evening movie when there is nothing else to do. So I bought it used, 3 DVDs for $25. Although it was cheap, my money would have been better spent on a nail to drive through my foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film started out nicely. Kinda Dark and mysterious. I was always enthralled with vampire and samurai movies as a kid. I thought the combo would be really cool. The first fight scene was pretty cool. I was excited for the rest of the movie. Then the movie took a serious nose dive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that this was a big hit in the east. I guess because of the twins. I don&#39;t see it though. This movie, aside from the first 10 minutes, was absolutely horrible. So many movies in this genre have the potential to be great, and blow it terribly. This is just another casualty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jacki Chan&#39;s role in this film doesn&#39;t make any sense at all. Whyyyyyyyy? Complete silliness. He probably made a few bucks off it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cool thing in this movie are the swords they use. Nice idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#39;t recommend this movie to anyone.&#34;

b&#39;Victor Jory never became a major star. He is better known for later character roles than for his early leads. But he was very handsome and an excellent actor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His love scenes with Loretta Young in this romantic adventure thriller are passionate. Their kisses look very real. And very modern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vivienne Osborne is a standout here also. She plays a woman with a reputation. But the character has a good heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The print I saw was not clear. But what a joy that rare movies like this are turning up! And they are, in some sort of watchable condition, still intact. This is nothing truly special. But if one is willing to sift through movies of its era with similarly intriguing titles, one is likely to find some suprtb movies.&#39;

b&#39;There are good-bad movies and bad-bad-movies and enjoyably bad movies...this isn\&#39;t one of them. This is a movie that doesn\&#39;t realize just how bad it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this at a screening on November 14, 2006 at the New Beverly Theater in Los Angeles as part of the &#34;Grindhouse Cinema&#34; this theater puts on every month. Hopefully presenters Eric Caiden &amp; co. will think twice before letting writer/director Lawrenece Foldes anywhere near them again. What a con man. The guy got up to speak before the film -- you would think he was Orson Welles talking about &#34;Touch of Evil&#34; or some other lost classic. Hardly. Nice of him to take up 20 minutes of the audiences\&#39; time with his incoherent rambling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Young Warriors&#34; has been described as a cross between &#34;Animal House&#34; and &#34;Death Wish&#34; but if you are expecting something along the lines of imitations like &#34;Revenge of the Nerds&#34; or &#34;The Exterminator&#34; you will be in for one sad disappointment. The script makes zero sense. The direction is so poor the actors looked embarrassed and what can you say when the best thing about the movie is watching a car blow up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor Richard &#34;shaft&#34; Roundtree. In this movie he plays another character with the first name of &#34;John&#34; but that\&#39;s about the only similarity his character here has to the aforementioned classic. I hope this film allowed him to pay the rent for another month. Other actors who look like they wished they could be anywhere else included Ernest Borgnine and Linda Day George. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a complete waste of time. Even the audience did not seem that into it (except for the one spazz-boy sitting in the back who yelled &#34;whoa&#34; every five minutes and his girlfriend who giggled with the fervor of a lobotomized talking Barbie every time he opened his mouth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For real films about vigilantes, I would suggest the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Death Wish I, II, III, Exterminator I, Vigilante Force, Ms. 45, Rolling Thunder, the No-Mercy Man (the latter two being a pair of films presented at this theater a couple of years ago -- probably the same budget as &#34;Young Warriors&#34; but both were a million times better!)&#39;

b&#39;I totally agree. This is &#34;Pitch Black underground&#34; and a well worn plot. The best scenes I thought were the divers exploring the caves, going through impossible subterranean passageways, some of them were heart pounding. The scenery was great. Had they dispensed with the staple &#34;alien&#34; toothy CGI badboys entirely the movie would have been much better. All they would have had to do is never show any monsters at all but have everyone wondering, and follow Jack\&#39;s descent into madness, and this might have been a top rate hitchcock-style thriller, maybe award material. The acting isn\&#39;t bad. But those rubber bats just reduce it to standard fare.&#39;

b&#34;From all the bad comments about this movie and add them up I feel the same way. It may look like the Australians are weaklings instead they were brave soldiers. In this film it was very terrible and too graphic. I didn&#39;t see enough heroism just more cowardice which is ashame because its nothing from what I read. We don&#39;t need the extremity of violence like that we can use our vivid imagination of what they went through. It&#39;s like saving private ryan where the nazi is pushing his knife slowly in the soldier. For example Mel Gibson is a over extreme director for his movies not because of the violence but for the level of historical inaccuracy. Letters of Iwo Jima was one of the war films that was close enough to history (although I could be wrong) except Flags of our Fathers and Bridge of the River Kwai. You&#39;re better off reading it its an insult to the victims and the fallen if you don&#39;t tell it right, and the movie drag on for too long there was nothing interesting about the dialogue and not enough retribution from the aussies to kill Japanese soldiers. Just read history on the internet, mags and in books. Movies always kill the sense of realization. What they did to POWs in Singapore and the Philippines was just dreadful escpically to civilians. It just makes me feel proud to see goodies beat the baddies but movies like this ruin it.&#34;

b&#39;I appeared as an extra and was on location as a journalist covering &#34;The Dain Curse&#34;. My involvement was during the segments of this film shot in Jim Thorpe, Pa. (Jim Thorpe was also one of the locations of the 1969 film &#34;The Molly Maguires&#34;). I reported the \&#39;action\&#39; in the Emmaus Free Press newspaper where I was editor 1978-80 (the paper ceased publication int he 1990s). I recall the excellent attention to detail of the period costumes, automobiles, etc. The modern asphalted streets of Jim Thorpe were covered with gravel to mimic a 1920s rural town of the south. At the time, I interviewed the producer and spoke briefly with the director during a set change break; I did not get to interview James Coburn which was always a great disappointment to me. As an aside, I appear briefly in one of the street scenes wearing a snap- brim hat and a tweed jacket. The producer asked me to &#34;jump in&#34; and it was a real thrill. I still have a collection of black and white stills I took of the production work for the newspaper. Someday, they may be of interest to film/television historians.--Lou Varricchio&#39;

b&#39;So I decided to watch the entire Puppet Master series, and had just watched parts 1-3, which I thought were ALL excellent. They had a unique charm to them, and a certain intelligence that I really appreciated. About a year ago, I even saw Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys, which of course was bad, but still a terrific guilty pleasure and fun to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the very beginning of this film, I knew it was in trouble. The cheesy Power Rangers-style Egyptian skull villain who watches the Puppets \&#39;Rita Repulsa-style\&#39; through his pyramid glass came straight out of left field! All of the additions to this franchise in this story were completely absurd! Suddenly we have a grand assortment of all kinds of new and random characters and plots that are a far cry from the first three films. I seriously doubt that when the first Puppet Master was being penned, the writers had visions of someday seeing an Egyptian Power Rangers villain, totem monsters, annoying twenty-somethings who seriously can\&#39;t act (and are supposed to be brilliant scientists but never say anything intelligent), and a lame &#34;Decapitron&#34; puppet who\&#39;s head can morph into the ghost of Toulon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that greatly disappointed me in this film was that it completely ignores what happened in the last entry (Part II, since III was a prequel). Suddenly, the puppets are back at Bodega Bay Inn, back in their case (minus Blade), and Toulon for some reason is willing to help his puppets again (he betrays them in part II for his love of Elsa). This isn\&#39;t explained AT ALL...and so with that, and all of this other junk thrown in, I was no longer amused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m a huge fan of ridiculous B movies, a connoisseur if you will. I even collect laser discs of rare B movies you can\&#39;t find on DVD, and so it takes a lot for me to say that this was one of the most absurd movies I have ever seen in my life. I still love those puppets, the original ones, Blade, Tunneler, Pinhead, Jester and the rest, and if they had only stuck with what they had rather than trying to fix something that wasn\&#39;t broken, well, the series might still be alive and in good health. That being said, even though the reviews aren\&#39;t so great, I\&#39;m really interested in checking out Puppet Master Retro, sounds like an interesting one that pays great tribute to the original themes.&#39;

b&#39;This movie is called &#34;Solomon Kane&#34;. Which it isn\&#39;t. The main character wears a hat, but that\&#39;s all he has in common with Robert Howard\&#39;s character Solomon Kane as known from early pulp magazines and lots of publications ever since these days. It is a fantasy movie, not really that bad and it might easily have passed with a rather good review - if it hadn\&#39;t been called Solomon Kane. The hero is a newly invented character who definitely is not SK. The story is not Robert Howard, neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a fantasy movie it is one more movie following the traditions of the genre: simple story, poor CGI, poor actors, poor directing. Yet it can be fun, you know: \&#39;the cheaper they are, the better they are\&#39;. But since it is called Solomon Kane, I cannot accept it. Imagine a Lord-of-the-Rings movie with a hero Bilbo who fights the black sorcerer Saugalf with the help of his dwarf friend Aragorn and the beautiful heroine Shadowfax. And with a final fight where the three use a magical ring to kill the evil sorcerer who has transformed into the dragon Gondorian. Imagine that. This is exactly what this movie has done with Robert Howard\&#39;s character Solomon Kane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;d give it a 4 stars review if it was just another horror movie, but since it is called Solomon Kane, I can only rate it 3 stars.&#39;

b&#39;&#34;First Snow&#34; has an intriguing beginning. A traveling salesman has his fortune told by an old man, who\&#39;s predictions turn out to be amazingly correct. From this point on the movie plays out like a bloated &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; episode. I mean nothing but car trips, phone calls and paranoia. William Fichtner gives his usual interesting performance, but Guy Pierce is anything but a sympathetic character, disregarding other people\&#39;s well being for the sake of his own paranoia. The ending is especially weak, with absolutely no payoff for the long suffering audience. Do yourself a big favor and avoid this one. Not recommended. - MERK&#39;

b&#39;I never really understood the controversy and hype this movie caused. Especially in French and the neighboring countries (in Belgium, where I am located, for example), &#34;Baise-Moi&#34; was announced as THE most shocking and THE most thought-provoking social drama you could ever experience. Yeah right! It might be a little shocking, maybe (how often do you see someone getting shot up the arse?), but the weak and pointless plot surely didn\&#39;t cause me to think much. &#34;Baise-Moi&#34; is another one of those &#34;blame everything that goes wrong on society&#34;-films and they\&#39;re generally not very convincing. About 99% of the people functions perfectly well in this society so why would you blame this exact same society for the vile and hopeless acts of two deranged nymph-girls? The two main characters and their miserable lives are introduced separately and in flashes. Nadine just killed her roommate; Manu shot her brother and the two meet in an abandoned train-station, late at night. They decide to travel around France together, leaving a trail of sex and blood behind wherever they made a stop. Although we\&#39;re constantly exposed to pornography and violence, this film is very boring to sit through. Like the girls are indicating themselves all the time, the dialogues are lame and the people they run into (and kill\xc2\x85) are very uninteresting. If people want to make porno movies, that\&#39;s fine by me, but please don\&#39;t pretend that it\&#39;s art-house film-making. If you leave out the swearing and the hip camera-work, all there is to see is (not so) arousing pornography. Cool soundtrack, though!&#39;

b&#39;This 1988 movie was shown recently on a cable channel. We wanted to see another film, which supposedly was starting, but because a mix up, Rent-a-Cop, was shown in that time slot. Never having seen it when it was commercially released, we took a chance at it. Bad decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One wonders what possessed the people behind the picture to go ahead with &#34;Rent-a-Cop&#34;, or how they sold it to the studio behind the distribution. It appears this movie misfired big time. This film doesn\&#39;t add anything new to its genre. It\&#39;s totally predictable, as once the basic premise is shown, we know how it will end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt Reynolds plays a wooden Church. This actor can do better, but who knows what was going on behind the scenes, or perhaps the direction given to him by Jerry London, had the opposite effect. Mr. Reynolds has one expression throughout the movie. He just doesn\&#39;t register any emotion at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa Minnelli, as the hooker who witnessed the original slaughter at the Chicago hotel, makes no sense at all. The romance between her Della and Church seems phony from the beginning. She and Mr. Reynolds play one dimensional characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t waste your time with this turkey.&#39;

</blockquote>
<p>So far we have been accessing our model endpoint by constructing a predictor object which uses the endpoint and then just using the predictor object to perform inference. What if we wanted to create a web app which accessed our model? The way things are set up currently makes that not possible since in order to access a SageMaker endpoint the app would first have to authenticate with AWS using an IAM role which included access to SageMaker endpoints. However, there is an easier way! We just need to use some additional AWS services.</p>
<p><img src="Web App Diagram.svg"></p>
<p>The diagram above gives an overview of how the various services will work together. On the far right is the model which we trained above and which is deployed using SageMaker. On the far left is our web app that collects a user's movie review, sends it off and expects a positive or negative sentiment in return.</p>
<p>In the middle is where some of the magic happens. We will construct a Lambda function, which you can think of as a straightforward Python function that can be executed whenever a specified event occurs. We will give this function permission to send and recieve data from a SageMaker endpoint.</p>
<p>Lastly, the method we will use to execute the Lambda function is a new endpoint that we will create using API Gateway. This endpoint will be a url that listens for data to be sent to it. Once it gets some data it will pass that data on to the Lambda function and then return whatever the Lambda function returns. Essentially it will act as an interface that lets our web app communicate with the Lambda function.</p>
<h3 id="Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">Setting up a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h3><p>The first thing we are going to do is set up a Lambda function. This Lambda function will be executed whenever our public API has data sent to it. When it is executed it will receive the data, perform any sort of processing that is required, send the data (the review) to the SageMaker endpoint we've created and then return the result.</p>
<h4 id="Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">Part A: Create an IAM Role for the Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Since we want the Lambda function to call a SageMaker endpoint, we need to make sure that it has permission to do so. To do this, we will construct a role that we can later give the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the <strong>IAM</strong> page and click on <strong>Roles</strong>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>. Make sure that the <strong>AWS service</strong> is the type of trusted entity selected and choose <strong>Lambda</strong> as the service that will use this role, then click <strong>Next: Permissions</strong>.</p>
<p>In the search box type <code>sagemaker</code> and select the check box next to the <strong>AmazonSageMakerFullAccess</strong> policy. Then, click on <strong>Next: Review</strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, give this role a name. Make sure you use a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>LambdaSageMakerRole</code>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">Part B: Create a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Now it is time to actually create the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the AWS Lambda page and click on <strong>Create a function</strong>. When you get to the next page, make sure that <strong>Author from scratch</strong> is selected. Now, name your Lambda function, using a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>sentiment_analysis_func</code>. Make sure that the <strong>Python 3.6</strong> runtime is selected and then choose the role that you created in the previous part. Then, click on <strong>Create Function</strong>.</p>
<p>On the next page you will see some information about the Lambda function you've just created. If you scroll down you should see an editor in which you can write the code that will be executed when your Lambda function is triggered. In our example, we will use the code below.</p>

<p>On the next page, make sure that <strong>New API</strong> is selected and give the new api a name, for example, <code>sentiment_analysis_api</code>. Then, click on <strong>Create API</strong>.</p>

<p>For the integration point, make sure that <strong>Lambda Function</strong> is selected and click on the <strong>Use Lambda Proxy integration</strong>. This option makes sure that the data that is sent to the API is then sent directly to the Lambda function with no processing. It also means that the return value must be a proper response object as it will also not be processed by API Gateway.</p>
<p>Type the name of the Lambda function you created earlier into the <strong>Lambda Function</strong> text entry box and then click on <strong>Save</strong>. Click on <strong>OK</strong> in the pop-up box that then appears, giving permission to API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function you created.</p>
